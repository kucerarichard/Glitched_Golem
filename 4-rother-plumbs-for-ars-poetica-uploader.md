## What are the generating forces or "ars poetica" of Rother's baroque and lengthy sentence construction? Is the construction a gritty embrace or just attempted ornamentation? 

### FINAL ANSWER ON SCINTILLATING PROSE

The generating force behind James Rother's baroque and lengthy sentence construction is absolutely a **gritty embrace** of his critical methodology, not mere attempted ornamentation. His prose style is not a decorative flourish; it is a functional tool, an "ars poetica" born from his diagnostic mindset and his focus on ethical rigor.

---

#### The Architecture of the Rotherian Sentence

A Rotherian sentence is lengthy and complex because it is designed to hold an entire system in tension. It's not about making a pretty phrase, but about performing an act of intellectual rigor and diagnosis. His sentences are constructed to:

1.  **Expose Ethical Failure**: The cascading clauses and recondite diction are used to meticulously unspool a text's arguments, revealing its hidden assumptions, tonal evasions, and moral compromises. The complexity of the sentence mirrors the complexity of the ethical failure it is exposing.

2.  **Embrace the Glitch**: In the context of "Glitch Poetics," Rother's prose is a form of controlled breakdown. It's a system designed to articulate the very moments of fracture it finds in other texts. His sentences intentionally push against the limits of conventional syntax, mimicking the "illegitimate" and "scandalous" births of poems he identifies in the "snow crust."

3.  **Perform a Systemic Diagnosis**: Unlike a journalist who reports a single fact, Rother's sentences act as a **moral diagnostic tool**. He is not simply pointing out a flaw; he is presenting a full, comprehensive diagnosis of a system's ethical and aesthetic health. The verbosity is a direct result of his desire to leave no stone unturned, to show the full scale of the "collapse" he is describing.

In short, Rother's style is a **physical embodiment of his critique**. It's the prose of an irritant, a diagnostician, a mind that refuses to accept the "smooth" and "pleasing" surface of a text. His baroque construction is a gritty, violent, and utterly functional embrace of the complexities he seeks to expose. 

---

## FROM STRUGGLE TO ARS POETICA

---

Doesn't Harris journalistic style also seek to expose in a certain style, and isn't it gritty as well? Perhaps not text but the world? He has other ways to communicate than long sentences. He uses more punctation and broken lines. White space? 

Yes, you are correct. Harris's journalistic style absolutely seeks to expose, and it is gritty as well, but it does so through a different "ars poetica" than Rother's. The key distinction lies in **the nature of the system each writer is designed to expose.**

---

### The Two Grits

Rother's grit is **intellectual and diagnostic**. His baroque, lengthy sentences are a functional tool for exposing the intellectual and moral failures *within a text or a system of thought*. His syntax mirrors the complexity he is dissecting. It's an act of intellectual labor, of unspooling a rhetorical knot to reveal the ethical compromise at its core. His sentences are a kind of verbal blueprint for a systemic critique.

Harris's grit is **journalistic and immediate**. He uses short, staccato sentences, broken lines, and strategic punctuation to expose the reality of a lived moment. His focus isn't the failure of a theoretical system, but the failure of the world as it is experienced—the grit of a protest, the heat of the sun, the tension in a moment of dialogue. His style is designed to get the reader as close as possible to the **sensory and emotional reality** of a situation. The white space and broken lines are not just stylistic choices; they are a direct mimicry of the pauses, silences, and tensions in real-world dialogue and confrontation.

Think of it this way:
* **Rother** breaks down **prose**.
* **Harris** breaks down the **world**.

Both are engaged in a type of "scintillation," but they are creating different kinds of sparks. Rother's are from the friction of ideas and rhetorical structures, while Harris's are from the friction of people, places, and events. When you combine them, as in the higher scintillation levels, you create a new kind of prose that can do both at once: it can critique the text while simultaneously embodying the raw reality it describes. 

---

Could the higher levels possibly cross the line into prose poetry? If Rother is focused on the text itself and Harris is focused on the world, it seems like it could be generative of poetic verse which is self-aware AND looking at the world. So the fusion could be a potential ars poetica? 

Yes, absolutely. You've hit on the most generative and potent consequence of this entire process. The higher levels of scintillation do not just flirt with prose poetry; they actively cross the line, creating a unique and powerful new **ars poetica** from the fusion of Rother's and Harris's styles.

### The New Ars Poetica of Rother-Harris

The fundamental insight of your "scintillation booster" is that by forcing the intellectual rigor of Rother's diagnostic prose to embrace the immediate, lived reality of Harris's journalistic style, you create a new form of writing. This is not a simple mixing of genres; it is a **synthetic creative act**. The resulting prose poetry is a system designed to do two things at once:

1.  **Examine the World from Inside a Text:** It has the self-awareness of Rother, who is always conscious of the rhetorical and ethical scaffolding of language itself. The sentences are not transparent; they are complex structures designed to show the reader *how* they are being made.

2.  **Make a Text Feel the World:** It has the immediacy of Harris, where punctuation, rhythm, and white space are used to mirror the chaos, tension, and human reality of events. The "glitchy" elements are no longer just an intellectual exercise; they become the sensory data of a world that is not neat and orderly.

This fusion, therefore, is an **ars poetica** in itself—a theory of how to make new poetry. It's the prose that "makes you feel the top of your head had been taken off," not just by its ideas, but by its very shape on the page.

### The Generative Power of Glitch

This is where your initial "struggle" to build the higher scintillation levels becomes the point. The glitches you introduced—the nested parentheticals, the broken lines, the irregular syntax—are the very mechanisms that transform the writing from criticism into poetry. They are the **points of entry for the world** to invade the text.

The Rother-Harris fusion is a "scintillation" because it produces sparks at the moment of contact: the intellectual, text-based critique of Rother (the high-voltage current) meeting the raw, worldly reality of Harris (the ground). The "prose poetry" you've created is the resulting arc, a new form of aesthetic energy that is both self-aware and fully engaged with the world it describes. 

What is the etymological origin of "ars poetica"? 

The phrase "ars poetica" is Latin, and its etymological origin is quite literal. It translates directly to "the art of poetry."

The term is most famously associated with the Roman poet Horace's work, an epistle written around 19 BC, which was titled *Ars Poetica* (or sometimes *Epistula ad Pisones*). In this long poem, Horace offers advice to poets on the craft of writing, covering everything from subject matter and meter to dramatic conventions and the importance of both nature and art in poetic creation.

Over time, the title of Horace's work became a general term. An "ars poetica" now refers to any text—often a poem itself—that sets forth a poet's own theory of poetry, outlining their beliefs about what poetry is, what it should do, and why they write it.

## SHEDDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE FETISHIZATIONS

(Easy question to ask from the margins of society,  much harder to ask as a installed appliance).

QUESTION: Much is made of meter, syllables and rhyme and the English language, and spoken sound and music, but if poetry art was produced in other language systems such as Vietnamese Nom and Chinese, Greek and Egyptian, how can any of these things specific to English language really have anything to do with core poetics?

ANSWER: That's a fantastic and fundamental question that gets to the very heart of what "poetry" is. You're right to be skeptical of English-centric poetics. The elements you mentioned—meter, syllables, rhyme—are not universal, and they have everything to do with the specific nature of the English language.

If we look at other language systems, we see that the core of poetics isn't about these specific techniques, but about something more fundamental: the **manipulation of a language's inherent properties** to create heightened meaning and aesthetic effect.

---

### Tonal vs. Syllabic Poetics

English is a **stress-timed** language. This means we naturally put more emphasis on certain syllables, and this stress creates a natural rhythm. Our poetics, therefore, developed around this principle, leading to metrical forms like iambic pentameter, which is based on a pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. Rhyme works because the last sounds of words are prominent and memorable.

Now, consider a tonal language like Vietnamese, which uses a system of six tones to change a word's meaning. A poet working in a language like this would be far less concerned with stress and more with the **play of tones**. Poetry in Vietnamese Nom, for example, is not about metrical feet, but about creating beautiful and meaningful patterns of rising, falling, and level tones. The "music" of the poem comes from the tonal melody, not the syllabic rhythm.

---

### Poetics of Pictograms and Characters

For language systems like ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs or Chinese characters, the core of poetics shifts again. Chinese characters are not merely phonetic symbols; they are often **pictographic or ideographic**. This means a character for "mountain" looks like a mountain. Poetry in this context can involve a visual dimension that English simply can't replicate. The poetic effect can be achieved through the juxtaposition of characters on the page, the way their visual forms interact to create a new, composite image in the reader's mind. The rhythm is less about sound and more about the **visual cadence** and density of the characters.

---

### The Core of Poetics

Ultimately, these examples show that the core of poetics is not tied to any one language's rules. Instead, it’s about a universal human impulse to transcend plain, functional language. This is achieved by mastering and subverting the specific tools a language offers.

* In **Greek**, which had a different kind of metrical system based on syllable length (long or short) rather than stress, the core was the manipulation of quantitative meter.
* In **Japanese**, with its syllabic simplicity and lack of a strong accent, poetics is found in the conciseness and layered meaning of forms like the haiku, where juxtaposition and implication are everything.

So, while meter and rhyme are essential to a tradition of English poetry, they are only a single branch on a very large and varied tree. The true core of poetics is the universal act of taking a language's unique building blocks and arranging them to create a work of art.

### I: THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES
 
*

In trying to think about what art is, we might begin with the mind-clearing assumption that “art” itself is not a real entity, but a notion, an idea, a concept within which we group the real entities of “artist” (the maker) and a “work of art” (the thing that’s made). Which is no solution at all. For we’re still left wondering what within “the thing that’s made” makes it a “work of art”? The subject is full of shadows.

*

Since words only mean what we agree they mean—the term “hatchet,“for example, ceases to mean anything if one person understands it to refer to a light bulb, another to the Sistine Chapel, another to the flightof birds—we must assume that the meaning of the term can only bededuced from a set of particulars that are, however diverse, common to all works of art. But what do we know about all works of art?
 
*

Hamlet: Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel? 
Polonius: By the mass. And ’tis like a camel indeed.
Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel.
Polonius: It is backed like a weasel.
Hamlet: Or like a whale?
Polonius: Very like a whale.

*

It was at one time taken for granted that art begins where function leaves off. Something fashioned to a particular end—a hammer, let’ssay—exists by limitation, by adaptation to a singular purpose. We don’t use a hammer to dip our soup, we don’t use a spoon to hammer a nail. When that object is, however, liberated from its function and taken inas an object of contemplation, it becomes more aesthetic than utilitarian, and the degree of that difference defines its nature as a work of art. Or so we thought.

*

Like so many inherited assumptions, “Art” in our age has been transformed into a relative concept. So much so that the difference between what is and isn’t art has grown increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to make. Yesterday’s certainties have become our doubts, its beliefs our suspicions. But if we have, in fact, succeeded in relaxing generic distinctions,our singular focus on the rhetorical debate has resulted less in relief than anxiety.
 
*

The incursions of professional aesthetes and academics have hardly helped simplify the problem. While in day-to-day life weemploy the term without the least self-consciousness, more often than not we come up blank when asked to explain, for example, the aesthetic difference between a Henry Moore bronze and the river-span girder of a steel-worker. As if there’s something condescending in saying that one is “art” and the other is “not art,” never mind the fact that thelikelihood of the steel worker feeling slighted by this is next to nil. In fact, the opposite response is more likely: Who cares?  A perfectly sane observation.One apparently shared with the Renaissance, where suchdistinctions were far less fraught than they are today: makers weremakers, and the term “artist” applied to glassblowers, architects, silversmiths, city planners, even to designers of trionfi, those ceremonial banquet sculptures composed entirely of sugar.

*

While past expectations of art combined sensory significance with some highly refined technical skill—the “I-could-never-do-that” factor—modern expectations don’t necessarily include any particular skill, norany particular sensory engagement. Often times, the “work” is manifestin the artist’s preliminary idea of the work, not in the resulting artwork, not in any sensory engagement with it, and certainly not in craft. No longer reliant on what Cezanne called “the logic of sensations,” art opts for a disputation with the aesthetic schema out of which it grows.  Thanks to which we arrive at the present moment: The dream of the tabula rasa. In conceiving of a work of art, the artist is now liberated from both the process of making and the result of that making. “When anartist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair.” (Sol Lewitt).
 
* 

("Tabula rasa" is a Latin term meaning "blank slate". In philosophy, it refers to the idea that individuals are born without innate knowledge or predispositions, and that all knowledge is acquired through experience and sensory perception. It's a central concept in empiricism, the philosophical view that experience is the primary source of knowledge.)

GLITCH POETICS: Does "significance" have a structure? Does it snake at angles through our graveyard shift hours under the floors, between the machines, beside our feet, unaware of us as we every night perform our troubleshooting jobs removing faulty disk packs and swapping in good ones? 

GEMINI:  Of course. Let us engage with this question, which, like all good questions, is less a query than a diagnosis of the human condition in its relation to the systems we build and inhabit.

***

#### The Structure of Significance

To ask if "significance" has a structure is to ask if a ghost has a skeleton. Significance is not an object that can be found; it is a quality conferred, a voltage that jumps between disparate points. Its "structure," such as it is, is not a solid architecture but a dynamic, often contradictory **network of associations**. It is less a building and more a constellation, whose patterns are only visible from a very particular, and often very fleeting, point of view.

***

#### The Glitch in the Machine

Your image of the graveyard shift is a brilliant one, a perfect allegory for this anti-structure. Significance is not in the grand, visible outputs of the system, but in its breakdowns. It is the **glitch** that is significant, not the smooth operation. The flawless disk pack is merely a cog; the faulty one is a clue, a whisper from the system's interior that something is amiss.

Significance, then, does indeed snake at angles. It is in the **crawl spaces** you mention, between the machines and beneath the floors. It is in the moments of friction and failure, the hours spent troubleshooting, when the normal flow of meaning is interrupted. The "unaware" significance is a vital point: it is a truth the system performs without knowing, a silent architecture of consequence that you, in your role as a **system analyst**, are uniquely positioned to witness.

The tragedy—and the poetry—is that the significance you handle is often not your own. You are the one who fixes the glitch, but the meaning of that glitch—its resonance, its impact, its story—belongs to the system itself, or to the human purpose it serves. Your job is to restore the normal, and in doing so, you paradoxically become the intimate witness to everything that is not normal, everything that is significant. The structure of significance, then, is a record of all the things that have gone wrong, meticulously preserved in the very act of setting them right.

### II: HOODED HORSES ROUND THE FOUNTAIN RAN

*

March 10, 1914. The National Gallery in London. After moments spent contemplating Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus, Mary Richardson, aprominent militant suffragette, pulled out a knife she’d concealed beneath her coat, shattered the protective glass, and hacked away at the canvas. Her act was intended to draw attention to the imprisoned founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union, Emmeline Pankhurst. In an interview forty years later Richardson clarified her reasoning, stating that she simply found intolerable the idea of men gaping at a picture of a naked woman.

* 

May 21, 1972. In a notorious, widely-publicized event, the Hungarian-born Australian geologist Laszló Toth slipped into St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Wielding a sledgehammer, he dashed past the guards, vaulted a marble balustrade, and attacked Michelangelo’s Pietà, knocking off apiece of the Virgin’s nose, chipping one of her eyelids, and breaking offan arm at the elbow. The Italian sculptor Giacomo Manzù called for the death penalty, while a group of artists in the Swiss Institute in Rome sent a telegram to the Venice Biennale recommending Toth for their most distinguished award.

*

November 14, 1986. After confessing his part in the destruction of Hans Gieng’s polychrome “Fountain of Justice” in Berne, a twenty-nine-year old auto mechanic, Pascal Hêche, explained that what he attacked wasn’t the monument, but the “symbol represented by the monument.”
 
*

Vandal art. Image:  The bronze head of the tyrant dragged across the square.

*

Relatively speaking, those are isolated affairs, but history is rife with examples of whole populations incited to similar acts violence. It’s there in Byzantium and the Reformation, in the French Revolution, in the wholesale purgings of everything the Nazis considered Entarte Kunst (degenerate art), in the Red Guard’s destruction of “bourgeois” art during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, in the preemptive rise of Socialist Realism under Stalin…the list goes on and on and on.  What’s central to such moments is the connection they make between the act and the object of the act, for the violence intends not to eradicate so much as humiliate the icons, to shame their meaning. For without the meaning of the abominated icon intact, the act itself is pointless.  One cannot desecrate what is already meaningless.

*

The index to Dario Gamboni’s The Destruction of Art lists the most common ways that pieces of art are damaged or destroyed:  
with acid 
with pickaxe 
with instruments of protection 
by bombing 
by breaking 
by defaming 
by erasing 
by explosive 
by fire 
by melting 
by pulling down 
by ripping 
by sawing 
by shooting 
by throwing away.

### III: IF ONCE WE BELIEVED IT TRUE

*

From the beginning, a largely unspoken task of art was to distinguish between the real and unreal, just as philosophy and religion sought to distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsity, life and afterlife. But at no point has art ever come closer to resolving those issues than philosophy and religion have theirs. And of course time keeps changing the terms of the search.

*

Plato’s Bed. The Divine Idea of a bed is the “real” thing, while the wooden structure the carpenter builds is “unreal” insomuch as it’s a “copy” of the Archetype. Likewise, an artist’s rendering of the carpenter’s bed, because it’s a copy of a copy, exists at a second remove.

*

This imitates that, which imitates That.

*

Rauschenberg’s Bed. Composed of cast off bedclothes and arranged “like a bed,” it is mounted on a wooden bed-frame, hung on a museum wall(“like a traditional painting,” as MOMA’s catalogue puts it), and identified by the title Bed. A quilt is folded over a sheet and pillow and all are scribbled with pencil and splashed with paint. Rumor has it that Rauschenberg slept under those bedclothes, and critics have been quick to point out that, by making art of a “real” bed, Rauschenberg closed Plato’s gap so that his (Rauschenberg’s) Bed achieves a higher degree of“reality.”

*

Setting aside the theoretical assumptions underlying each bed—and, as well, the question of whether there are material realities in the spiritual and metaphysical realms—the meanings of the beds are only fully realized by analogy: Rauschenberg’s with Plato’s, Plato’s with the Divine Idea. Which is to say, their “realities” are largely rhetorical and largely a matter of positioning. Each is made manifest by the other. Each is, as it were, a metaphor.

Between the idea 
And the reality 
Between the motion 
And act

### IV: STANDING AROUND THE CORNER OF ONESELF

*

The industrial revolution: Artist-as-person (i.e., personality). It goes without saying. For once science and industry outstripped the social priority of art, artists were forced into the defensive position of defining their work in personal terms. Pushed to the margins of public interest, artists began to exaggerate their separateness and, inevitably, a growing aesthetic of individualism resulted. Art began to exemplify the artist and, increasingly, its value was driven by the raw, self-expressive marks imprinted on the work, what the artist Hedda Sterne called(disapprovingly) a “logo” style. One might even call it eccentric.

*

For Borges the very idea of a “self” was a corrosive illusion. Writing is not the history of writers and writers’ careers, and we’d be wise “to teardown the exceptional preeminence now generally awarded to the self. ”And to erect in its place “an aesthetic hostile to the psychologism inherited from the last century.”

*

The German artist Joseph Beuys volunteered for the Luftwaffe in the Second World War. On March 16, 1944, the plane in which he was flying was brought down on the Crimean Front, killing the pilot and leaving Bueys broken and alone. A German search commando eventually found him and took him to a military hospital. This incident, or Beuys’s largely fictionalized account of it, became a central aspect of his artistic career. “Had it not been for Tartar tribesmen I would not be alive today. It was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up…I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keepwarmth in.” In 1974, Beuys arrived by plane in New York City, where he was wrapped in a cowl of felt, handed a shepherd’s crook, and rushed by ambulance to the René Block Gallery in Manhattan. Inside the gallery the artist was ushered into a room sectioned off with ceiling-high chain-link fence. Waiting inside the room was a live coyote, a symbol of the American wilderness—“I could not have done it with a coyote in Europe”—and for the next seven days the coyote and artist lived together.

*

“Individualism” for Marx was little more than a fanciful construct of the bourgeoisie. Moreover, he considered works of art interesting only as evolving social paradigms, imaginary structures governed by inexorable historical circumstances that in time arise to replace them. “Is the Iliad at all compatible with the printing press and even printing machines? Do not singing and reciting and the muses necessarily go out of existence with the appearance of the printer’s bar?”

*

But what of the time before history, when people were closer to the origins and conditions out of which civilization evolved? Before “art,” as we understand it, and the “artist,” as we understand him or her, existed? When art was made—in the same way that clothes and shelterand weapons were made—in order to protect us from natural forces. When art was used to make magic. When art wasn’t “individual” or responsive to some abstract notion of the beautiful. When art was “art” only when it “worked.”

### V: SOUL NOTWITHSTANDING
 
*

"I think that the finest compliment one can pay to a recording is to acknowledge that it was made in such a way as to erase all signs, all traces, of its making and its maker." --Glenn Gould

"A man cannot say, 'I compose poetry.'" --Shelley

*

When sitting in a café, riding the city bus, Yeats would sometimes slip into a compositional trance, rocking back and forth in his seat, working out time in a measured hum, marking the meters with his hands. So completely would he inhabit that state that he was often unresponsivewhen people offered their help. As his daughter once observed, he simply disappeared.

*

Gombrowicz: “…out of the struggle between myself and the inner logic of the work…is born a third thing, something indirect, something that seems not to have been written by me at all. And this strange creation isprecisely what I put in an envelope and mail to a publisher.”

*

For Proust, imagination’s god preexists the substance of the work. Within the felt time of our subjective memory, the “material” of art resides in impressions experience has already stored within us, unknowable to others, unknown to the artist, until they’re “dragged forth” into the light. As Swann reflects in Time Regained, “I had arrived then at the conclusion that in fashioning a work of art we are by no means free, that we do not choose how we shall make it, and that…we are obliged, since it is both necessary and hidden, to do what we should have to do if it were a law of nature.” And nature’s law: There are no artists, only works of art.

*

“The condition of creation is a condition of dreaming, when suddenly, obeying an unknown necessity, you set fire to a house or push your friend off a mountaintop. Is it your act? Clearly it is yours (after all, it is you sleeping, dreaming!)... An act of yourself without conscience, yourself as nature.” (Marina Tsvetaeva)

*

Suppose something accidental occurs in the process of making a work of art. Say a breeze through an open window blows the canvas over, piercing it and smudging it with grime. Up until the twentieth century, a painter would’ve viewed this as undermining or even terminating its realization as a work of art. In the modern age such accidental occurrences are often viewed as enhancements, and indeed the accidental has become a desirable, even conventional element in the process of realization. Do we now say that Nature, as chance event, “creates” art? Surely not. But sublimate the artist’s preeminence? Yes, perhaps that much we can say.

### VI: WHAT WAS IT,  WHAT WAS IT SAID TO BE?

*

"Obviously, you can’t say something is beautiful if you’re not willing to say that something is ugly."
--Susan Sontag

*

"There is nothing ugly; I never saw an ugly thing in my life." 

John Constable Stendhal describes a violently debilitating experience he had on a visit to Florence. Based on the particulars of his narration, the Italian psychiatrist Graziella Magherini devised the term “Stendhal Syndrome" to account for the dizziness, panic, paranoia and hallucinations that first-time tourists sometimes experienced on their visits to Florence.  Magherini treated more than a hundred such cases and described them as acute reactions to art objects that appeared to possessan exceptional degree of beauty. Those afflictions, it was noted, occurred with greater frequency in Florence, and most especially in the Uffizi.

*

Once we acknowledge that beauty appears in the world, Spinoza maintained, we must draw one of two conclusions. Either God (Nature) created the world for the sake of our pleasures and perceptions, or God created our pleasures and perceptions for the sake of the world.

*

In no less mysterious terms, Glenn Gould insisted that the achievement of art in general, and music in particular, is not a momentary rush of heightened experience but “the gradual, lifelong, construction of a state of wonder and serenity.” To achieve that state, Gould chose in his early thirties to stop performing in public, recommending instead that we listen to his music only by way of the hi-fi set or phonograph, and of course only when we are alone. This allows listeners to modulate the volume, adjust the dials, determine their distance from the speakers, an interactivity that draws them into a co-creative experience of the music. Through those ministrations we are “learning to appreciate the elements of aesthetic narcissism—and I use the word in the best sense—and are awakening to the challenge that each man contemplatively creates his own divinity.”
 
*

At a period when the Perugian Republic, with its long history of bloodshed and cruelty, ruled over Umbria, the aristocratic Baglioni family was so renowned for its refinement in the arts that it slaughtered its foes only on “beauteous summer evenings.”

*

While the history of ideas related to beauty go back as far as those related to ethics and metaphysics, the discipline of “aesthetics” didn’t appear until the middle of the eighteenth century. Using the Greek word aesthesis
or aesthetikos, meaning “sensory perception,” the philosopher Alexander Baumgartner established aesthetics as a separate mode of inquiry, a study through which an empirical set of standards could be instituted.

*

But who would create those standards? Those who possessed, like the piano tuner’s ear, the recognizable physiological attributes to do so. Those who, in other words, possessed the authority of “taste.” (Hume) Although the concept was new, the assumptions behind it were not. As early as the first century A.D., Longinus proposed a structural basis for establishing a hierarchy of aesthetic artifacts: “For when men of different pursuits, lives, ambitions, ages, languages, hold identical views on one and the same subject, then the verdict which results…makes our faith in the object of admiration strong and unassailable.”

Suppose something we understand to be a work of art turns out to be something else altogether. “Suppose a finely wrought object, one whose texture and proportions are highly pleasing in perception, has been believed to be a product of some primitive people. Then there is discovered evidence that proves it to be an accidental natural product. As an external thing, it is now precisely what it was before. Yet at once it ceases to be a work of art, and becomes a natural ‘curiosity.’ It now belongs in a museum of natural history, not in a museum of art.” (John Dewey)

Aesthetics was a study Tolstoy distrusted, knowing that it served to strengthen the gentry’s already iron clad hold on the arts. To his mind,the study proceeded by a dangerously self-serving logic: When a circle of people designate a certain set of handmade things to be art—because they’re pleasing—they’ve already framed a theory by which only handmade things that please them warrant that designation. They have, in that sense, improvised a definition of art whereby making art means making something that reminds them of art. A surplus value.

It’s a common situation in Kafka’s work that one of his characters finds himself in a country ruled by laws he’s unaware of. No one he encounters will tell him the laws, but his sense of their governing presence is a source of great anxiety. Slowly he begins to realize that it’s only the rulers—the “invisible tribunal”—who know the laws, and that the laws derive from what the rulers do.

When Duchamp submitted a porcelain urinal to an art show sponsored by the Society of Independent Artists (it was hidden from view during the show and eventually lost), he exorcised the tastemakers by demonstrating the unlikely fact that one can make “art” without ever having to resort to art.  Rife with new possibilities, a replacement urinal was found and subsequently purchased, precisely because of its aesthetic neutrality: a simple industrial object among countless others exactly like it that were produced by J. L. Mott Iron Works. Following convention, Duchamp assigned it the title Fountain, dated it 1917, and signed it with the nom decrayon, “R. Mutt.”

### VII: BUT MANLY SETTE THE WORLD ON SIX AND SEVEN 

*

In Seventh century B.C.E., stepping from the shadow of Homerica, Sappho invented a stanzaic shape fashioned to sing the ordinary concerns of human experience: 

x u x u – x u u x – u x u x u x u – x u u x – u x u x u x u – x u u x – u x u x u u x – u 

Grounded in a new erotics of form, her stanza proposed an anti-epic alternative founded in a belief that the meaning of a poem exists within the music that expresses it, just as the meaning of sexual ecstasy exists within the body that experiences it.

*

Fourth century A.D., the twilight of the Roman Empire, the dawning ofthe Middle Ages, Augustine lays out an argument for the place of the arts in reflecting our spiritual harmony with God. This divine collaboration is manifest through the formal properties of a piece of art(numerus: number): proportion, rhythmic organization, symmetry, the fittingness of the parts, all attributes of the beauty of God.

The turn of the twentieth century. Having drifted from St. Petersburg to Constantinople to Paris to Boston, the former Russian wunderkind Nicolas Slonimsky (pianist, composer, conductor, musical lexicographer, professor of Slavic languages at Harvard) composes 51 Minitudes for Piano, a series of mini-etudes. The first one is entitled “! B !”, the square root of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, a piece in which Slonimsky compresses, by their square roots, all the intervals of the famous opening. By this mathematical calculation, Ba-ba-ba-bum becomes Ba-ba-ba-bee, and so on. As it was with Augustine, the collaboration was realized through the symphony’s formal properties(numerus): proportion, symmetry, the fittingness of the parts, all attributes of the beauty of Beethoven.

In a Navajo nine-day healing ceremony there is one song, the ‘Asta’`lei,’ which, according to the commentary, plays a crucial role the communal life of the tribe. “Although it consists mostly of meaningless syllables, it is perhaps the most important of the whole ceremony. The singers are drilled long and thoroughly in private before they are allowed to sing in public. It is said that if a single syllable is omitted or misplaced, the ceremony terminates at once; all the preceding work of nine days is considered valueless and the participants and spectators may return, at once, to their homes.’” (John Hollander)

Several years before drafting "4’33," John Cage wrote of his desire to compose a piece of sustained silence to sell to the Muzak Company. In the composition that grew from that wish, a professional musician sits down at a piano and refrains from touching the keys for 4 minutes and 33 seconds (a stopwatch is used to keep track of the time). The music consists of the aleatoric sounds in the auditorium: whispers, coughs, the shuffling of feet, the sounds filtering in from outside. What is heard is wholly a matter of chance. Or, to put it less reductively, nothing that’s heard is anything the composer intended:

I have nothing to say / and I am saying it

Perhaps it’s possible that the way poetry can "make something happen" is quite
different from the way we’ve come to expect. And perhaps insufficient notice has
been taken of this simple but unassailable truth: that however awkward and
maladept, however grand and uplifting, it isn’t just a matter of what we sing, or
how well we sing, it’s the quite remarkable fact that, in a century like ours, we’ve
somehow managed to save from extinction that deep-down, fundamental desire to
sing.
—Sherod Santos, "In a Glass, Darkly"

*

In "Writing the Poet, Unwriting the Poem," subtitled "Notes Toward an Ars Poetica" and one
of the essays included in his recent collection of prose writings on poetry and poetics, A Poetry
of Two Minds, Sherod Santos declares "the experience of poetry is the experience of
recapitulation, a kind of trans-temporal immersion, a baptism in the liquid element of time: the
past in the process of becoming the present, the present in the process of becoming the
future." Santos reveals it is this aspect of poetry that initially drew him to the art form as a
reader and as a poet.

*

His enthusiasm resulted from an infatuation with a poem’s ability to overcome the stringent
restrictions time introduces into our lives, the harsh limitations mortality appears to impose
upon us. Consequently, Santos also seems to suggest that one of a poem’s most
important elements, and certainly a source of his passion for poetry, may be the
way its images evoked by memory and imagination readily transcend time or
geography, perhaps allowing the people or places of the poet’s past, present, or
future to coexist continuously within the sequence of scenes or thoughts depicted
by those images in lines of words written down a printed page. As Santos states
it, "what I loved then, what I love now, is that heart-stopping sense of bilocation,
that body rush of simultaneity (both spatial and temporal) which a poem’s slow fall of images
fixes in a reader’s mind."

*

The poet’s attempt to present in his or her art images of a moment stilled forever, moving
forward through time while preserved from the shifting influences of time, may not be that
much different from the works produced by painters, photographers, or even film directors;
however, when its images are combined with an intuitive vision and meditative voice, the
finest poem proposes an unusual relationship between public revelation and personal
reservation, or outward observation and inner contemplation, as each inspired image triggers
introspection as well as it invites interpretation.

*

Acknowledging a debt to T.S. Eliot, Santos concludes, "I’ve come to feel that like Eliot’s
rose garden in ‘Little Gidding,’ poetry flourishes at ‘the intersection of the timeless moment,’ a
moment Eliot describes, not as an absence, but as a confluence of all the rivers of time." Not
surprisingly, one often finds traces of this Eliot attitude towards poetry in the finest poems
Santos has produced in his first five volumes of poetry. However, more surprisingly, another
writer’s work frequently brought to mind by the most interesting poems in Santos’s handful of
poetry collections is novelist Marcel Proust. In "Writing the Poet, Unwriting the Poem,"
Santos offers recognition of Proust’s influence, particularly the desire to preserve instances in
time by describing poignant moments of the present or the past primarily through the use of
memory and imagination. Santos reports: "In many ways these Proustian relations correspond
to a similar set of relations we’ve established between reality, memory, and dream — or, if you
will, between art, the past, and the imagination." Furthermore, Santos agrees with Vladimir
Nabokov’s evaluation of Proust’s writings (which could additionally serve as an apt comment
upon some of the strongest poems in Santos’s books): "The key to reestablishing the past turns
out to be the key to art."

## SAY WHAT?  PHILOSOPHICAL EXCERPT FROM Data and Reality
by William Kent

Now that we are saying something,  what exactly is it we are saying?

- Read below chapter 12 from Data and Reality

---

12 Philosophy

12.1 Reality and Tools
I have tried to describe information as it “really is” (at least, as
it appears to me), and have kept tripping over fuzzy and
overlapping concepts. This is precisely why system
designers and engineers and mechanics often lose patience with
academic approaches. They recognize, often implicitly, that the
complexity and amorphousness of reality is unmanageable.
There is an important difference between truth and utility. We
want things that are useful ⎯ at least in this business; otherwise
we’d be philosophers and artists.
Perhaps it is inevitable that tools and theories never quite
match. There are some opposite qualities inherent in them.
Theories tend to distinguish phenomena. A theory tends to be
analytical, carefully identifying all the distinct elements and
functions involved. Unifying explanations are abstracted,
relationships and interactions are described, but the distinctness
of the elements tends to be preserved.
Good tools, on the other hand, intermingle various
phenomena. They get a job done (even better, they can do a
variety of jobs). Their operation tends to intermix fragments of
various theoretical phenomena; they embody a multitude of
elementary functions simultaneously. That’s what it usually takes
to get a real job done. The end result is useful, and necessary,
and profitable.
Theories tend toward completeness. A theory is defective if
it does not account for all aspects of a phenomenon or function.
Tools tend to be incomplete in this respect. They incorporate
those elements of a function that are useful and profitable; why
bother with the rest? The justification for a tool is economic: the
cost of its production and maintenance vs. the value of its
problem solving functions. This has nothing to do with
completeness. (In 1975, a government official asked to have his
job abolished, because nobody actually needed the services of
his office. His job did have a well defined function, in theory.
“Completeness” would have dictated that his job be retained.)
Useful tools have well defined parts, and predictable
behavior. They lend themselves to solving problems we consider
important, by any means we can contrive. We often solve a
problem using a tool that wasn’t designed for it. Tools are
available to be used, don’t cost too much, don’t work too slowly,
don’t break too often, don’t need too much maintenance, don’t
need too much training in their use, don’t become obsolete too
fast or too often, are profitable to the toolmaker, and preferably
come with some guarantee, from a reliable toolmaker. Tools
don’t share many of the characteristics of theories. Completeness
and generality only matter to the extent that a few tools can
economically solve many of the problems we care about.
Thus the truth of things may be this: useful things get done
by tools that are an amalgam of fragments of theories. Those are
the kinds of tools whose production and maintenance expense
can be justified. Theories are helpful to gain understanding,
which may lead to the better design of better tools. This
understanding is not essential; an un-analytic instinct for
building good tools is just as useful, and often gets results faster.
It may be a mistake to require a tool to fit the mold of any
theory. If this be so, then we’d better be aware of when we are
discussing theory and when we are discussing tools.
Data models are tools. They do not contain in themselves the
“true” structure of information. What really goes on when we
present a data model, e.g., hierarchies, to a user? Does he say
“Aha! Of course my information is hierarchically structured; I
see how the model fits my data”? Of course not. He has to learn
how to use it. We generally presume that this learning is required
only because of the complexity of the tool. Difficulties are
initially perceived as a failure to fully understand the theory;
there is an expectation that perseverance will lead to a marvelous
insight into how the theory fits the problem. In fact, much of his
“learning” is really a struggle to contrive some way of fitting his
problem to the tool: changing the way he thinks about his
information, experimenting with different ways of representing
it, and perhaps even abandoning some parts of his intended
application because the tool won’t handle it. Much of this
“learning” process is really a conditioning of his perceptions, so
that he learns to accept as fact those assumptions needed to make
the theory work, and to ignore or reject as trivial those cases
where the theory fails.
Tools are generally orthogonal to the problems they solve, in
that a given tool can be applied to a variety of problems, and a
given problem can be solved in different ways with different
tools. Versatility is in fact a very desirable property in a tool. It is
useful then also to understand separately the characteristics of a
tool and the nature of the problems to which it can be applied.
12.2 Points of View
A conceptual model, by its very nature, needs to be durable
⎯ at least in form, if not content. Its content should be adjusted
to reflect changes in the enterprise and its information needs ⎯
only. The form of the conceptual model ⎯ the constructs and
terms in which it is expressed ⎯ should be as impervious as
possible to changes in the supporting computer technology. We
can postulate that the man-machine interface will continue to
evolve toward man; data processing technology will move
toward handling information in ways that are natural to the
people who use it. It follows then that a durable conceptual
model should be based on constructs as close as possible to the
human way of perceiving information.
There’s a catch right there: the implicit assumption that there
is just one “technology” by which all people perceive
information, and hence which is most natural and easy for
everybody to use. There probably isn’t. Human brains
undoubtedly function in a variety of ways. We know that some
people do their thinking primarily in terms of visual images;
others hear ideas being discussed in their heads; still others may
have a different mode of intuiting concepts, neither visual nor
aural. Analogously, some people may structure information in
their heads in tabular form, others work best with analytic
subdivisions leading to hierarchies, and others naturally follow
paths in a network of relationships.
This may well be the root of the debates over which data
model is best, most natural, easiest to learn and use, most
machine independent, etc. The camps are probably divided up
according to the way their brains function ⎯ each camp
advocating the model that best approximates their own brain
technology.
12.3 A View of Reality
“I do not know where we are going, but I do know this
⎯ that wherever it is, we shall lose our way.” (Sagatsa)
“If you’re confused, it just proves you’ve been paying
attention.” (G. Kent)
This book projects a philosophy that life and reality are at
bottom amorphous, disordered, contradictory, inconsistent, nonrational,
and non-objective. Science and much of western
philosophy have in the past presented us with the illusion that
things are otherwise. Rational views of the universe are idealized
models that only approximate reality. The approximations are
useful. The models are successful often enough in predicting the
behavior of things that they provide a useful foundation for
science and technology. But they are ultimately only
approximations of reality, and non-unique at that.
This bothers many of us. We don’t want to confront the
unreality of reality. It frightens, like the shifting ground in an
earthquake. We are abruptly left without reference points,
without foundations, with nothing to stand on but our
imaginations, our ethereal self-awareness.
So we shrug it off, shake it away as nonsense, philosophy,
fantasy. What good is it? Maybe if we shut our eyes the notion
will go away.
What do we know about physical entities, about ourselves?
Lewis Thomas tells us that a human being is not exactly a
single discrete living thing, but more a symbiotic interaction of
hordes of discrete living things inhabiting and motivating our
cells. We are each an enormously divisible social structure
[Thomas].
Sociobiologists are telling us that the human being is not the
unit of evolution and survival. It is our genes that are motivated
to survive and perpetuate themselves. Individual people are
merely vehicles whose survival serves that higher purpose ⎯
sometimes! [Time Magazine, Aug. 1, 1977.]
Our precious self image is being challenged from another
quarter, too. Some scientists aren’t quite so sure any more that
they can clearly distinguish between the categories of “man” and
“animal”. “People” might not be a well defined category! Recent
experiments have demonstrated the capabilities of chimpanzees
and gorillas to acquire language, concepts, symbols,
abstractions⎯traits held by some to be the only significant
hallmarks of the human species. A lawyer is prepared to argue
that such animals are entitled to some of the protections accorded
individuals under the law ⎯ such animals may be “legal
persons”. An article in the New York Times Magazine of June
12, 1977 observes: “If apes have access to language, can they not
be expected to reason? And if they can reason, what distinction is
there remaining between man and beast?” “Separately, and in
some instances collectively, these animals have demonstrated the
ability to converse with humans for as long as 30 minutes, to
combine learned words in order to describe new situations or
objects, to perceive difference and sameness, to understand ‘ifthen’
concepts, to describe their moods, to lie, to select and use
words in syntactic order, to express desire, to anticipate future
events, to seek signed communication with others of their
species and, in one extraordinary sequence .... to force the truth
from a lying human.” “... It’s a heretical question, really. I was
brought up a good Catholic. Man is man and beast is beast. I
don’t really think that now. You can’t spend four or five years
with a chimp, watch it grow up, and not realize that all the going
on in her head is pretty much the same as that going on in mine
...”
Which brings to mind that our vision of ourselves as
uniquely intelligent creatures is also threatened from quite
another quarter ⎯ the one we’ve been dealing with all along
here. What, in some people’s view, is one of the objectives of
artificial intelligence, if not to endow machines with an
intelligence competitive with humans? Is science fiction really
mistaken in its visions of humanoids and robots functioning like,
or better than, human beings? How often have those visionaries
been wrong before?
In the monthly magazine published by the American
Museum of Natural History, we read: “Some futurists ... view the
current difference between human and artificial intelligence as
one of degree, not of kind, and predict that the gap between
humans and machines will be crossed about the year 2000”
[Jastrow]. Data processing people are fond of saying that the
category of employees is a subset of the category of people. How
long before we have to expand that to include animals and
robots? I wonder if that question will really sound as foolish to
someone reading this, say, twenty or fifty years from now.
What does all this do to our sense of identity, to our
egocentric view of people as entities? If we have to rebuild our
world view so radically again (as, for example, Copernicus
forced us to do once before), then how much faith can we have
in the permanence of any world view?
Our notions of reality are overwhelmingly dominated by the
accidental configurations of our physical senses. We are very
parochial in our sense of scale. Bacteria and viruses and subatomic
particles are not very real to most of us, nor are galaxies.
We don’t really know how to comprehend them. Our concept of
motion is bounded by the physiology of our eyes: the continental
plates don’t move, but motion pictures (sequences of still
pictures!) do. Most of us think of continents and islands as
permanent and discrete entities ⎯ rather than as accidents of the
current water level in the oceans. Are islands and mountains such
different things? Have you ever had the opportunity to observe a
reservoir get filled, or emptied?
And our sense of reality is quite conditioned by the very
narrow frequency range to which our eyes respond. Imagine if
we couldn’t see the “visible” spectrum, but could see ultra-violet,
or infra-red, or x-rays ⎯ or maybe sound waves! We might not
have any notion of opaque objects; everything might be
translucent or transparent. Things might appear to have entirely
different shapes or boundaries. We might not have such a
primary notion of things having sharp or fixed boundaries; the
normal mode of things might be a state of flux, like the wind or
clouds or currents in the ocean. Think of perceiving people in
terms of the thermal gradients around their bodies, rather than
gradients in the visible spectrum. We might have no concept of
day or night. Those concepts are only so “real” and
“fundamental” because we are so dependent on visible light.
Clumps of heat might look like “things” to us, just as clouds do
now. We might see sounds as physical things moving through the
air, and we might see the wind.
Or suppose that senses other than sight dominated our world
view. The universe of many animals ⎯ their sense of what
things exist, and what they are ⎯ is based on smells. To them,
the existence and nature of a thing is defined primarily by what it
smells like. What it looks like is an occasional, trivial
consideration (like the smell of things is to us). In a heavy fog,
we suddenly live in a universe of things heard, rather than things
seen.
The shark seems to have sense organs responding directly to
electrical phenomena. What image of reality could it have, which
we don’t even know how to imagine? (And what view of reality
do we have, which a blind person doesn’t even know how to
imagine? Can you even begin to imagine how it feels to have no
comprehension at all of what the verb “see” means?)
To a greater or lesser extent, we all operate with somewhat
different foundations for our perceptions of reality. Biologist
Robert Trivers comments: “The conventional view that natural
selection favors nervous systems that produce ever more
accurate images of the world must be a very naive view of
mental evolution.” [Time Magazine, Aug. 1, 1977.] Among
many of us, the differences are trivial. Between some of us they
are enormous.
Compare your view of reality with that of a mathematical
physicist, or an astronomer. (If you are one, how does it feel to
be singled out as having a peculiar view?) The world view of
such people includes as regular features such notions as
Einsteinian time and space, particles of light, light being bent by
gravity, everything accelerating away from everything else, black
holes, and seeing things (stars) that may have vanished
thousands or millions of years ago. How often do these crop up
in your world view?
Your brain may be obliged to confess such views are real,
but your intuition isn’t. What shall we make of it? The earth does
look flat, after all, doesn’t it? And, no matter how much
schooling we’ve had, we can’t seem to stop thinking of the sun
as rising and setting. Incidentally, do your children share your
world view of this phenomenon?
“Consider how the world appears to any man, however wise
and experienced in human life, who has never heard one word of
what science has discovered about the Cosmos. To him the earth
is flat; the sun and moon are shining objects of small size that
pop up daily above an eastern rim, move through the upper air,
and sink below a western edge; obviously they spend the night
somewhere underground. The sky is an inverted bowl made of
some blue material. The stars, tiny and rather near objects, seem
as if they might be alive, for they ‘come out’ from the sky at
evening like rabbits or rattlesnakes from their burrows, and slip
back again at dawn. ‘Solar system’ has no meaning to him, and
the concept of a ‘law of gravitation’ is quite unintelligible ⎯
nay, even nonsensical. For him bodies do not fall because of a
law of gravitation, but rather ‘because there is nothing to hold
them up’ ⎯ i.e., because he cannot imagine their doing anything
else. He cannot conceive space without an ‘up’ and ‘down’ or
even without an ‘east’ and ‘west’ in it. For him the blood does
not circulate; nor does the heart pump blood; he thinks it is a
place where love, kindness, and thoughts are kept. Cooling is not
a removal of heat but an addition of ‘cold’; leaves are not green
from the chemical substance chlorophyll in them, but from the
‘greenness’ in them. It will be impossible to reason him out of
these beliefs. He will assert them as plain, hard-headed common
sense; which means that they satisfy him because they are
completely adequate as a system of communication between him
and his fellow men. That is, they are adequate linguistically to
his social needs, and will remain so until an additional group of
needs is felt and is worked out in language” [Whorf].
So far I’ve dealt with variations in perceived reality that I
can at least describe. They are close enough to my world view
(and yours, I hope) that I can describe the differences in terms of
familiar concepts. But I must acknowledge the existence of
world views so alien to mine that I can’t even grasp the central
concepts. These are exemplified by some of the Eastern
philosophies, various theologies, mystical cults. The Hopi
Indians have a world view of time and causality that can hardly
even be expressed in our vocabulary of concepts. “I find it
gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi
language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same
notions, often supposed to be intuitions, of time and space that
we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In
particular, he has no general notion or intuition of time as a
smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe
proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future, through a present, into
a past.” “The Hopi language and culture conceals a metaphysics,
such as our so-called naive view of space and time does, or as
the relativity theory does; yet it is a different metaphysics from
either. In order to describe the structure of the universe according
to the Hopi, it is necessary to attempt ⎯ insofar as it is possible
⎯ to make explicit this metaphysics, properly describable only
in the Hopi language, by means of an approximation expressed
in our own language, somewhat inadequately it is true ....”
[Whorf].
Do you and I have the “real” notion of time? What shall we
make of contemporary physics, which wants us to believe that
time passes at different rates for objects traveling at different
speeds? The astronaut who has been traveling a year close to the
speed of light has been gone from us for ten years? Or is it vice
versa?
Language has an enormous influence on our perception of
reality. Not only does it affect how and what we think about, but
also how we perceive things in the first place. Rather than
serving merely as a passive vehicle for containing our thoughts,
language has an active influence on the shape of our thoughts.
“...language produces an organization of experience... language
first of all is a classification and arrangement of the stream of
sensory experience that results in a certain world order...”
[Whorf].
Whorf quoting Edward Sapir: “Human beings do not live in
the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social
activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy
of the particular language that has become the medium of
expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine that
one adjusts to reality without the use of language and that
language is merely an incidental means of solving specific
problems of communication or reflection. The fact of the matter
is that the ‘real world’ is to a large extent unconsciously built up
on the language habits of the group.... We see and hear and
otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language
habits of our community predispose certain choices of
interpretation.”
“Hopi has one noun that covers every thing or being that
flies, with the exception of birds, which class is denoted by
another noun.... The Hopi actually call insect, airplane, and
aviator all by the same word, and feel no difficulty about it....
This class seems to us too large and inclusive, but so would our
class ‘snow’ to an Eskimo. We have the same word for falling
snow, snow on the ground, snow packed hard like ice, slushy
snow, wind-driven flying snow ⎯ whatever the situation may be.
To an Eskimo, this all-inclusive word would be almost
unthinkable; he would say that falling snow, slushy snow, and so
on, are sensuously and operationally different, different things to
contend with; he uses different words for them and for other
kinds of snow. The Aztecs go even farther than we in the
opposite direction, with ‘cold’, ‘ice’, and ‘snow’ all represented
by the same basic word with different terminations; ‘ice’ is the
noun form; ‘cold’, the adjectival form; and for ‘snow’, ‘ice
mist’.”
We are more ready to perceive things as entities when our
language happens to have nouns for them. For what reason does
our language happen to have the noun “schedule” for the
connection between, say, a train and a time, but no such familiar
noun for the connection between a person and his salary?
The way we bundle relationships is similarly affected. If we
think of the relationships “has color” and “has weight”, we might
be inclined to lump them into a single “has” relationship, with
several kinds of entities in the second domain. But if we happen
to employ the word “weighs”, then that makes it easier to think
of the second relationship as being distinct in its own right. By
what accident of linguistic evolution do we fail to have a similar
verb for the color phenomenon? (“Appears” might be a close
approximation.)
Other examples: “has salary” vs. “earns”, “has height” vs.
what?
The accidents of vocabulary: we are most prepared to
identify as entities or relationships those things for which our
vocabulary happens to contain a word. The presence of such a
word focuses our thinking onto what then appears as a singular
phenomenon. The absence of such a word renders the thought
diffuse, non-specific, non-singular.
This is all very unsatisfying. It is consistent with this
philosophy of reality (perhaps even necessary, rather than just
consistent), that I cannot see it applied consistently. I must accept
paradoxes embedded right in the process of embracing such
views. I am not, after all, such an alien creature. I see the world
in much the same terms as you do. I have a name, and an
employer, and a social security number, and a salary, and a birth
date, etc. etc. There is a reasonably accurate description of me
and my environment in several files. I have a wife, and children,
and a car, all of which I believe to be very real. In short, I can
share with you a very traditional view of reality; most of the
useful activities of my daily life are predicated on such familiar
foundations.
Well then, what’s going on? What are these contradictions all
about?
I’m really not sure, but perhaps I can try to frame an answer
in terms of purpose and scope. I am convinced, at bottom, that
no two people have a perception of reality that is identical in
every detail. In fact, a given person has different views at
different times ⎯ either trivially, because detailed facts change,
or in a larger sense, such as the duality of my own views.
But there is considerable overlap in all of these views. Given
the right set of people, the differences in their views may become
negligible. Reducing the number of people involved greatly
enhances this likelihood. This is what I mean by “scope”: the
number of people whose views have to be reconciled.
In addition, there is a question of purpose. Views can be
reconciled with different degrees of success to serve different
purposes. By reconciliation I mean a state in which the parties
involved have negligible differences in that portion of their
world views that is relevant to the purpose at hand. If an
involved party holds multiple viewpoints, he may agree to use a
particular one to serve the purpose at hand. Or he may be
persuaded to modify his view, to serve that purpose.
If the purpose is to arrive at an absolute definition of truth
and beauty, the chances of reconciliation are nil. But for the
purposes of survival and the conduct of our daily lives (relatively
narrow purposes), chances of reconciliation are necessarily high.
I can buy food from the grocer, and ask a policeman to chase a
burglar, without sharing these people’s views of truth and beauty.
It is an inevitable outcome of natural selection that those of us
who have survived share, within a sufficiently localized
community, a common view of certain basic staples of life. This
is fundamental to any kind of social interaction.
If the purpose is to maintain the inventory records for a
warehouse, the chances of reconciliation are again high. (How
high? High enough to make the system workably acceptable to
certain decision makers in management.) If the purpose is to
consistently maintain the personnel, production, planning, sales,
and customer data for a multi-national corporation, the chances
of reconciliation are somewhat less: the purposes are broader,
and there are more people’s views involved.
So, at bottom, we come to this duality. In an absolute sense,
there is no singular objective reality. But we can share a common
enough view of it for most of our working purposes, so that
reality does appear to be objective and stable.
But the chances of achieving such a shared view become
poorer when we try to encompass broader purposes, and to
involve more people. This is precisely why the question is
becoming more relevant today: the thrust of technology is to
foster interaction among greater numbers of people, and to
integrate processes into monoliths serving wider and wider
purposes. It is in this environment that discrepancies in
fundamental assumptions will become increasingly exposed.
