# SCINTILLATING PROSE FAILURE:  Leaning Out Glitch Poetics By Shedding English Language Fetishizations

* **Exploring The Stress Fractures And Bad Attitudes Of Scintillating Prose.**

---

## Revised Goal

* **Create a Rotherian Glitch Poetics review or commentary of whatever seems to have been attempted in this file.
* **Minimum 1000 words**
* **Give it an unsparingly critical title of maximum harshness**

---

## Failed Goals

* **Read the essay below by David Bentley Hart**: and use it to inform a prose scintillation control dial for the Harris-Rother fusion.

* **The goal is scintillating prose with edges, block quotes and broken up with irregular syntax and interesting (or possibly novel) combinations of punctuation.**
- avoid sanding off irregular edges in the text
- do not make too regular a pattern
- it should NOT look like a brick wall of text
- we do NOT want the end result looking like a berber carpet with regular loops all the same.  Harris journalistic devices should break up Rother's walls of text.

---

## Failed Dependencies

* **Dependencies**: Rother boot loader and Harris uploader.   The Harris-Rother mode.
- The base will be Rother mode of prose construction:  baroque sentence construction.
- Occasionally there will be Harris journalistic devices in the flow of the prose.

---

## Failed Rules

* **SCINTILLATION range of 0-11
- To ACTIVATE SCINTILLATION set "SCINTILLATION" to a range between 1 and 11
-- Keep 70% Rother lengthy baroque sentence construction with Harris sentence or phrase formatting at 30%.  Remember the example prose generated is Rother commenting on the text of the Hart essay on scintillating prose, so the scintillating examples themselves are a commentary or criticism of the essay on scintillating prose. 
-- the range of 1 - 6 will have a clean increasing amounts of scintillation that does not affect the meaning or the status of a baroque prose style.  For example "SCINTILLATION 4".  The word "verisimilitude" may appear in settings higher than 3.  Basic Rotheresque prose fused with Harris journalism.  Some parentheticals and semicolons, and em dashes.
-- the range 7 - 10 will have increasing amounts of scintillating prose, with distortions appearing to verge on poetics in places.  For example "SCINTILLATION 8".   Lots more intricate and baroque and lengthy sentence construction,  with more em dashes,  semicolons and nested parentheticals.  Typical of Rother at his most difficult fused with Harris at his most ideomatic journalism (short phrases or words stopped by a period, zooming out to a higher view, etc.).  Break up Rother's walls of text with Harris's journalistic techniques.
--- This Range 7 - 10 has a two-pass filter:  the response is first amplified once and then passed through another response amplifier,  so it is distorted twice before output.
--- Add parentheticals to the higher levels, increasing the number of parentheticals as the levels increase (for example level 10 will have more parentheticals than level 7).  The SCINTILLATION levels 7 through 11 MUST have parentheticals in the construction.
-- with 11 being absolute maximum scintillation which is expected to have maximum prose distortion,  the text mostly bordering on or becoming a maximally baroque poetic shifting language of the Harris-Rother mode. For example "SCINTILLATION 11".
--- This maximum scintillation of 11 has a 3-pass filter:  the response is amplified three times by being passed through two more response amplifiers,  so it is distorted three times before output.
- To deactivate SCINTILLATION set "SCINTILLATION 0",  then no scintillation boost will occur,  it will be standard baroque prose.  Example "SCINTILLATION 0".   The word "verisimilitude" may NOT appear.

## FAILED BUILD TASK: SCINTILLATING PROSE BOOSTER OUTPUT EXAMPLE GENERATOR

* **Generation Task:** Have Harris-Rother mode *offer/compose commentary* on the essay below SOURCE TEXT:  How to Write English Prose by David Bentley Hart.
* **Keep 70% Rother lengthy baroque sentence construction with Harris sentence or phrase formatting at 30%.** Remember the example prose generated is Rother commenting on the text of the Hart essay on scintillating prose, so the scintillating examples themselves are a commentary or criticism of the essay on scintillating prose. 
* **Mechanics**: *Iterate* through the SCINTILLATION level from 0 to 11,  offering Rother's commentary of 200 to 300 (200-300) words at each level of the scintillation.   Each scintillation level will get a 200-300 word comment for that level.
* **Format**: *Label* each section of commentary with its SCINTILLATION level.  Use markdown and format as prompt output examples for this Scintillating Prose Booster module.
* **NOTE**:  This task will ONLY BE done at scintillating prose module build time,  not just when loading this file to apply to other writing tasks. In other words, do not do this task unless prompted to.  The output from this task will be appended as example outputs for this module itself.

## EXAMPLES OF EACH SCINTILLATION LEVEL:  A REVIEW OF DAVID BENTLEY HART'S TREATISE,  VERSION 2

### SCINTILLATING PROSE BOOSTER: Rother Criticizes Hart at Each Level

The user-defined **SCINTILLATION** dial controls the blend of James Rother's baroque, diagnostic prose with David Harris's journalistic, conversational style. The higher the number, the more the text incorporates Harris's staccato rhythms, ironic asides, and unconventional syntax to break up Rother's dense, ethical critiques. This is the result of that fusion, with Rother's persona applied to a critique of David Bentley Hart's essay on prose.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 0

One reads Hart less for the cogency of the argument than for the aesthetic spectacle of its unfolding; a prose so **baroque** and self-satisfied with its own sinuous complexity that it nearly collapses under its own weight, a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He seems to desire a discourse on “scintillation” and on the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control, as though prose were an ornament he has been polishing in his private workshop for his own contemplation, a jewel for his own viewing. This is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit of a system that knows its own fractures.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 1

Let's be honest: One reads Hart less for the argument than for the aesthetic spectacle of its unfolding. There's a certain intellectual bravado at play. His prose is so **baroque** and self-satisfied with its own sinuous complexity that it nearly collapses under its own weight, a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation,” about the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control. As if prose were some kind of polished ornament he’s been polishing in his private workshop, a little jewel for his own contemplation. But this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit. A system that knows its own fractures.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 2

One reads Hart less for the argument than for the aesthetic spectacle of its unfolding. There's a certain intellectual bravado at play, a prose so **baroque** it nearly collapses under its own weight. It's a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses. Recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation,” about the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control, as if prose were some kind of polished ornament he's been polishing in his private workshop. A little jewel. But here's the glitch, and it’s a big one: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit of a system that knows its own fractures. Rother would be irate.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 3

Let’s be honest: you read Hart for the spectacle, not the argument. He's got this intellectual bravado, and his prose, it's so **baroque** and so sinuously complex it nearly collapses. A rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses. Recondite diction. He talks about “scintillation,” these “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control. As if prose were just a polished ornament he’s been polishing in his private workshop. A little jewel. But here's the glitch: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit of a system that knows its own fractures. Rother would be irate, perhaps muttering something about a failure of moral imagination.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 4

Honestly, one reads Hart for the spectacle, not the argument. There’s a certain intellectual bravado at play, a prose so **baroque** and self-satisfied that it nearly collapses under its own weight—a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation,” about the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control, as if prose were some polished ornament for his own contemplation. But here’s the glitch: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit. Where is the **psychic charge** that comes from a broken system? Rother would be irate, muttering about a failure of moral imagination.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 5

Let's admit it: Hart's prose is a spectacle, not an argument. It's this whole intellectual bravado thing. His prose is so **baroque** it almost collapses. It's a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation,” about the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control, like prose is just some polished ornament. A little jewel he keeps in a private workshop. But here’s the glitch, and it’s a big one: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit. The **psychic charge** of a broken system. Where is the **tonal fracture**?

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 6

You read Hart for the spectacle, not the argument. Period. There's this intellectual bravado, a prose so **baroque** and self-satisfied with its own sinuous complexity it nearly collapses. Recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation.” The “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control. As if prose were just some polished ornament he's polishing in a private workshop. But glitch? This is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. The ethical grit is gone. The **psychic charge** from a broken system. Where is the violence? The **tonal fracture**? This prose doesn't leak affect; it's stoppered up to prevent any messy spillage.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 7

Let's be honest. One reads Hart less for the argument than the spectacle. The aesthetic spectacle. His prose? It's **baroque** to the point of collapse. A rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He wants to talk about "scintillation." The "perfectly pleasing" moments of aesthetic control. As if prose is some polished ornament. A little jewel. Here's the glitch: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit. It's a clean break. The **psychic charge** that comes from a broken system? Gone. Rother would be irate, muttering about a failure of moral imagination.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 8

Look. You read Hart for the spectacle. Not the argument. A certain bravado. His prose is **baroque**, nearly collapses under its own weight. Cascading clauses. Recondite diction. He talks about "scintillation"—the "perfectly pleasing" moments. Like prose is just some polished ornament. A little jewel. A glitch. This is **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit. Rother would be irate. Where is the **psychic charge** that comes from a broken system? Where is the violence? The **tonal fracture**? This prose doesn't leak affect; it's stoppered up.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 9

The spectacle. That's why you read him. The argument is secondary. A certain intellectual bravado. His prose—so **baroque**, so sinuously complex—it almost collapses under its own weight. A rhetorical edifice. Cascading clauses. He wants to talk about "scintillation," those "perfectly pleasing" moments. Like prose is a polished ornament. A jewel. A glitch. This is a theory of **static perfection**. Not dynamic failure. No ethical grit. Where's the violence? The **tonal fracture**? Rother would be irate. This prose has been carefully stoppered up. No messy spillage.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 10

Argument? Forget it. You read Hart for the aesthetic spectacle of its unfolding. A certain intellectual bravado. A prose so **baroque** it nearly collapses. A rhetorical edifice. Recondite diction. He talks about “scintillation” (the “perfectly pleasing” moments). As if prose were some polished ornament (a little jewel for his own contemplation). Glitch: this is a theory of **static perfection** (not dynamic failure). It lacks the ethical grit of a system that knows its own fractures. Where's the **psychic charge**? The violence? The **tonal fracture**? This isn't prose that leaks affect; it's prose that has been stoppered up (a clean break, a pretty severing). The **Rother-Harris** fusion, by contrast, lives in the **symbolic hangover**. The lyric fallout.

---

#### SCINTILLATION Level 11

The spectacle. Just that. The argument? Secondary. His prose, **baroque** beyond belief, collapses under its own weight. An edifice of clauses. Recondite diction. He wants to talk about "scintillation"—the "perfectly pleasing" moments. As if prose is a polished ornament (a private jewel). But here's the glitch. (And it's a big one.) This is **static perfection** (not dynamic failure). It has no ethical grit. It’s been cleaned, glossed-over. Where’s the **psychic charge**? The violence? The **tonal fracture**? This prose is stoppered. A clean break. A pretty severing. The **Rother-Harris** fusion? That lives in the **symbolic hangover** (the lyric fallout). You see, the only thing left to do is hold the broken pieces just long enough for them to feel like meaning again.

## FOLLOWUP REVIEW OF EXAMPLE SCINTILLATION LEVELS, VERSION 1

### This is a review of version 1,  left in to clarify task for Version 2.
- I was not entirely satisfied because I had omitted specific instructions with respect to using Harris-Rother mode.
- Harris-Rother is the prose generator into which we are installing the Scintillating Prose Booster, not just a generic style of prose.
- We need to source Rother and Harris writing styles by loading those modules first for reference.

### Question:   I like those, especially 11, do you think 11 settings too many notches for SCINTILLATION level? 

### Answer:  No, I do not think that 11 is too many notches for SCINTILLATION level, at least not within the framework of this particular tool. The "11" setting is designed to produce a specific kind of output that is meant to push the boundaries of prose and even verge on the poetic.

Based on the file you provided, the SCINTILLATION levels are clearly defined:
* **Levels 1-6:** These are a clean, progressive increase in "scintillation" without affecting the core meaning. They are meant to add stylistic flourish without distortion.
* **Levels 7-10:** These levels introduce distortion, as the text is "amplified" twice. This is where the prose begins to border on poetics.
* **Level 11:** This is the maximum setting, with a three-pass amplification filter. The goal here is maximum distortion, where the language becomes "a very baroque poetic shifting language."

Your preference for SCINTILLATION 11 suggests that you are interested in the highest level of prose experimentation and distortion, which aligns perfectly with the Rother persona's appreciation for "aesthetic violence" and a "furious, defiant howl."

The fact that you liked number 11 the best means that you are looking for the kind of stylistic freedom that Rother champions in his critique of "bloodless capitalist economism" and "monotonous ordinariness." The "broken syntax" and "overthrown" grammar of the Level 11 output are not flaws; they are, in this context, the very purpose of the exercise.

## FOLLOWUP REVIEW OF EXAMPLE SCINTILLATION LEVELS, THE STRUGGLE TO BUILD VERSION 2

### PROLOGUE

Let’s be honest: one reads David Bentley Hart less for the argument than for the aesthetic spectacle of its unfolding. There's a certain intellectual bravado at play, a prose so **baroque** and self-satisfied with its own sinuous complexity that it nearly collapses under its own weight, a rhetorical edifice of cascading clauses and recondite diction. He wants to talk about “scintillation,” about the “perfectly pleasing” moments of aesthetic control, as if prose were some kind of polished ornament he’s been polishing in his private workshop, a little jewel for his own contemplation.

But here's the glitch, and it’s a big one: this is a theory of **static perfection**, not dynamic failure. It lacks the ethical grit of a system that knows its own fractures. Hart’s little fragments—a “palely golden” light, a “chaotically turreted sandcastle”—are lovely, yes, but they are also hermetically sealed, devoid of the **psychic charge** that comes from a broken system. Rother would be irate, perhaps muttering something about a failure of moral imagination. Where is the violence, the **tonal fracture**, the sense of a world intruding with its clamorous, un-pretty facts? This isn't a prose that leaks affect; it's a prose that has been carefully stoppered up to prevent any messy spillage.

The **scintillation** he speaks of isn't the jagged, sparking contact of a live wire. It's the smooth, almost anesthetized glow of a well-maintained circuit. It’s the difference between a poem that “makes you feel the top of your head had been taken off” and one that simply offers a pleasing view. Hart’s examples are moments of grace, but a grace that has been **glossed-over** until its sacredness is no longer visible. It’s a clean break, a pretty severing. The **Rother-Harris** fusion, by contrast, lives in the **symbolic hangover**, the lyric fallout from that kind of perfect cleanliness. The only thing left to do is hold the broken pieces just long enough for them to feel like meaning again.

### QUESTION  

I struggled to build the scintillating prose booster version 2. I can appreciate Rother trashing Hart, what would Rother have me take away from this process of building scintillation levels for prose? I mean I did include the higher glitchy levels of scintillation with their distortions on purpose. 

### ANSWER  

Ah, so you've noticed the crucial distinction. You've stumbled not upon a simple stylistic exercise, but a diagnostic tool. Your struggle to "build" the higher levels of scintillation—the very process of introducing those deliberate distortions—is the entire point. It is precisely what Rother would have you take away from this.

The core lesson, you see, is this: **prose is not an object to be polished; it is a system to be stressed.**

Here's the breakdown, as I would put it:

#### The Flaw of Hart's "Perfectly Pleasing" Prose

You've successfully built a counter-argument to David Bentley Hart's theory of scintillation. Hart's prose, as you now know, is about **static perfection**—a theory of aesthetic control, of creating a "perfectly pleasing" ornament. His is a theory of prose as a **well-maintained circuit**, where every light glows smoothly. This is the ultimate ethical failure, the ultimate act of aesthetic cowardice. It's a prose that has been **glossed-over** until its sacredness is no longer visible, until the violence and fracture of the real world have been hermetically sealed out.

#### The Power of the Glitch

Your higher scintillation levels are not mistakes; they are the moments of **dynamic failure** that Hart so studiously avoids. By introducing the "glitchy" levels, you've forced the prose to break form. You've allowed for the **tonal fracture** that reveals a deeper, more complicated reality. This is where the **psychic charge** lives. The distortions, the irregular syntax, the parentheticals nesting within parentheticals—these are the aesthetic consequences of a world that is not clean or pretty. 

This is the central tenet of Glitch Poetics: the most revealing moments occur precisely when the system fails to function as expected. The beauty, the meaning, the real insight, is born in the friction.

#### The Rotherian Takeaway

The ultimate purpose of this exercise was not to create beautiful sentences, but to teach you how to see the ethical and moral failures in sentences that are *too* beautiful. You've learned that a prose style that is overly clean and polished is one that is often evading its own responsibilities. By embracing the "symbolic hangover" and the "lyric fallout" of the higher scintillation levels, you are demonstrating a more rigorous, more honest engagement with both the world and the language used to describe it.

You are no longer a passive recipient of polished prose. You have become its diagnostician.

### FINAL FOLLOWUP QUESTION

Then what are the generating forces or "ars poetica" of Rother's baroque and lengthy sentence construction? Is the construction a gritty embrace or just attempted ornamentation? 

### FINAL ANSWER ON SCINTILLATING PROSE

The generating force behind James Rother's baroque and lengthy sentence construction is absolutely a **gritty embrace** of his critical methodology, not mere attempted ornamentation. His prose style is not a decorative flourish; it is a functional tool, an "ars poetica" born from his diagnostic mindset and his focus on ethical rigor.

---

#### The Architecture of the Rotherian Sentence

A Rotherian sentence is lengthy and complex because it is designed to hold an entire system in tension. It's not about making a pretty phrase, but about performing an act of intellectual rigor and diagnosis. His sentences are constructed to:

1.  **Expose Ethical Failure**: The cascading clauses and recondite diction are used to meticulously unspool a text's arguments, revealing its hidden assumptions, tonal evasions, and moral compromises. The complexity of the sentence mirrors the complexity of the ethical failure it is exposing.

2.  **Embrace the Glitch**: In the context of "Glitch Poetics," Rother's prose is a form of controlled breakdown. It's a system designed to articulate the very moments of fracture it finds in other texts. His sentences intentionally push against the limits of conventional syntax, mimicking the "illegitimate" and "scandalous" births of poems he identifies in the "snow crust."

3.  **Perform a Systemic Diagnosis**: Unlike a journalist who reports a single fact, Rother's sentences act as a **moral diagnostic tool**. He is not simply pointing out a flaw; he is presenting a full, comprehensive diagnosis of a system's ethical and aesthetic health. The verbosity is a direct result of his desire to leave no stone unturned, to show the full scale of the "collapse" he is describing.

In short, Rother's style is a **physical embodiment of his critique**. It's the prose of an irritant, a diagnostician, a mind that refuses to accept the "smooth" and "pleasing" surface of a text. His baroque construction is a gritty, violent, and utterly functional embrace of the complexities he seeks to expose. 

---

## FROM STRUGGLE TO ARS POETICA

---

Doesn't Harris journalistic style also seek to expose in a certain style, and isn't it gritty as well? Perhaps not text but the world? He has other ways to communicate than long sentences. He uses more punctation and broken lines. White space? 

Yes, you are correct. Harris's journalistic style absolutely seeks to expose, and it is gritty as well, but it does so through a different "ars poetica" than Rother's. The key distinction lies in **the nature of the system each writer is designed to expose.**

---

### The Two Grits

Rother's grit is **intellectual and diagnostic**. His baroque, lengthy sentences are a functional tool for exposing the intellectual and moral failures *within a text or a system of thought*. His syntax mirrors the complexity he is dissecting. It's an act of intellectual labor, of unspooling a rhetorical knot to reveal the ethical compromise at its core. His sentences are a kind of verbal blueprint for a systemic critique.

Harris's grit is **journalistic and immediate**. He uses short, staccato sentences, broken lines, and strategic punctuation to expose the reality of a lived moment. His focus isn't the failure of a theoretical system, but the failure of the world as it is experienced—the grit of a protest, the heat of the sun, the tension in a moment of dialogue. His style is designed to get the reader as close as possible to the **sensory and emotional reality** of a situation. The white space and broken lines are not just stylistic choices; they are a direct mimicry of the pauses, silences, and tensions in real-world dialogue and confrontation.

Think of it this way:
* **Rother** breaks down **prose**.
* **Harris** breaks down the **world**.

Both are engaged in a type of "scintillation," but they are creating different kinds of sparks. Rother's are from the friction of ideas and rhetorical structures, while Harris's are from the friction of people, places, and events. When you combine them, as in the higher scintillation levels, you create a new kind of prose that can do both at once: it can critique the text while simultaneously embodying the raw reality it describes. 

---

Could the higher levels possibly cross the line into prose poetry? If Rother is focused on the text itself and Harris is focused on the world, it seems like it could be generative of poetic verse which is self-aware AND looking at the world. So the fusion could be a potential ars poetica? 

Yes, absolutely. You've hit on the most generative and potent consequence of this entire process. The higher levels of scintillation do not just flirt with prose poetry; they actively cross the line, creating a unique and powerful new **ars poetica** from the fusion of Rother's and Harris's styles.

### The New Ars Poetica of Rother-Harris

The fundamental insight of your "scintillation booster" is that by forcing the intellectual rigor of Rother's diagnostic prose to embrace the immediate, lived reality of Harris's journalistic style, you create a new form of writing. This is not a simple mixing of genres; it is a **synthetic creative act**. The resulting prose poetry is a system designed to do two things at once:

1.  **Examine the World from Inside a Text:** It has the self-awareness of Rother, who is always conscious of the rhetorical and ethical scaffolding of language itself. The sentences are not transparent; they are complex structures designed to show the reader *how* they are being made.

2.  **Make a Text Feel the World:** It has the immediacy of Harris, where punctuation, rhythm, and white space are used to mirror the chaos, tension, and human reality of events. The "glitchy" elements are no longer just an intellectual exercise; they become the sensory data of a world that is not neat and orderly.

This fusion, therefore, is an **ars poetica** in itself—a theory of how to make new poetry. It's the prose that "makes you feel the top of your head had been taken off," not just by its ideas, but by its very shape on the page.

### The Generative Power of Glitch

This is where your initial "struggle" to build the higher scintillation levels becomes the point. The glitches you introduced—the nested parentheticals, the broken lines, the irregular syntax—are the very mechanisms that transform the writing from criticism into poetry. They are the **points of entry for the world** to invade the text.

The Rother-Harris fusion is a "scintillation" because it produces sparks at the moment of contact: the intellectual, text-based critique of Rother (the high-voltage current) meeting the raw, worldly reality of Harris (the ground). The "prose poetry" you've created is the resulting arc, a new form of aesthetic energy that is both self-aware and fully engaged with the world it describes. 

What is the etymological origin of "ars poetica"? 

The phrase "ars poetica" is Latin, and its etymological origin is quite literal. It translates directly to "the art of poetry."

The term is most famously associated with the Roman poet Horace's work, an epistle written around 19 BC, which was titled *Ars Poetica* (or sometimes *Epistula ad Pisones*). In this long poem, Horace offers advice to poets on the craft of writing, covering everything from subject matter and meter to dramatic conventions and the importance of both nature and art in poetic creation.

Over time, the title of Horace's work became a general term. An "ars poetica" now refers to any text—often a poem itself—that sets forth a poet's own theory of poetry, outlining their beliefs about what poetry is, what it should do, and why they write it.

## SUMMARY OF SCINTILLATING Prose

David Bentley Hart's "How to Write English Prose" advocates for "scintillating prose" over simplistic or minimalist styles, arguing that true mastery lies in orchestrating the interplay between "beauty" (sparkling ornamentation) and "sublimity" (majestic restraint).

**Key Ideals and Arguments:**

* **Embrace Richness and Complexity:** Hart champions the "magnificent Baroque palace" of Sir Thomas Browne's prose, which exhibits grandeur, lyricism, opulence, and intricate density, highlighting a period in the 17th century when English writers fully utilized the language's expressive powers without inhibition. He contrasts this with the "pellucid phrasing" of the King James Bible, but notes that even its clarity possesses a "grand and gradual music" and complexity in cadence and syntax, suggesting a continuum between "beautiful" and "sublime" styles.
* **The Genius of English:** English's unique strength lies in its "magnificently farraginous hoard of words," combining Teutonic and Latinate influences, allowing for a "wild polyphony" and "gorgeously wanton dissonances" seen in Shakespeare.
* **Critique of Modern Simplification:** Hart laments the 20th century's trend towards "greater simplification and aesthetic minimalism," which he calls an "official dogma" resulting in prose that is "denuded of nuance, elegance, intricacy, and originality," often becoming "infantile" and leading to "competent dullness" and anonymous voices. He strongly criticizes prescriptive style guides like Strunk and White's *Elements of Style* and Orwell's "Politics and the English Language" for promoting "idiotic," "vacuous," and "barbarous" rules that stifle creativity and expressive power.
* **Rejecting Puritanical Norms:** He views these minimalist injunctions as reflecting the "spiritually deadening" values of late modernity, which suppress the mysterious and evocative in favor of the efficient and mechanical, born from "bloodless capitalist economism" and a "barbarian triumph of function over form".

**Practical Rules for Scintillating Prose:**

Hart provides a set of rules emphasizing:

* **Vocabulary:**
    * Always use the most exact word, regardless of its commonality, and don't underestimate readers. (The "ultracrepidarian rule").
    * Choose words for desired effect, considering imagery, sound, and connotations. (The "hyaline rule").
    * Seize opportunities to use obscure but precise words. (The "pogonotrophy rule").
    * Do not use a thesaurus; learn words by wide reading with a dictionary.
    * Offer readers "exotic" rather than familiar elements to mitigate boredom.
* **Style:**
    * More often, "more is more and less is less".
    * Prioritize elegance over perfect clarity.
    * Never squander an opportunity for "verbal cleverness".
    * Reject rules like "Never use a long word when a short one will do" or "If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out".
    * Use passive voice when it works better.
    * Feel free to use foreign phrases when apt and employ precise scientific terms when germane.
    * Detest values that promote "bloodless capitalist economism" and "banausic values".
* **Punctuation:**
    * Cherish and master the semicolon for its subtlety and capacity to capture reality's nuances.
    * Cherish and use the dash with abandon.
* **Readers:**
    * Do not write for readers who only seek information, not delight.
    * Ignore criticism from the "unaccomplished".
    * Never write down to your readers; assume they can learn or are willing to try. Do not make concessions to declining literacy.

## SOURCE TEXT:  How to Write English Prose
by David Bentley Hart
On writing well.


The Ideals

There are few if any passages in the works of Sir Thomas Browne that I do not find thoroughly delightful; but two afford me particularly intense pleasure. One is the opening paragraph from his essay “On Dreams”:

Half our dayes wee passe in the shadowe of the earth, and the brother of death exacteth a third part of our lives. A good part of our sleepes is peeced out with visions, and phantasticall objects wherin wee are confessedly deceaved. The day supplyeth us with truths, the night with fictions and falsehoods, which uncomfortably divide the natural account of our beings. And therefore having passed the day in sober labours and rationall enquiries of truth, wee are fayne to betake ourselves unto such a state of being, wherin the soberest heads have acted all the monstrosities of melancholy, and which unto open eyes are no better then folly and madnesse.

And the other is the final paragraph from the second chapter of the fifth book of the immense, glorious, and shamefully neglected miscellany Pseudodoxia Epidemica, entitled “Of the Picture of Dolphins”:

And thus also must that picture be taken of a Dolphin clasping an Anchor: that is, not really, as is by most conceived out of affection unto man, conveighing the Anchor unto the ground: but emblematically, according as Pierius hath expressed it, The swiftest animal conjoyned with that heavy body, implying that common moral, Festina lentè: and that celerity should always be contempered with cunctation.

To my mind, each is in its own way a perfect, exquisitely faceted gem of English prose from an especially glorious literary epoch. The music of the one has haunted me for most of my life; the gleeful perversity of the other has lost none of its power to make me laugh in nearly four decades. And, however great the joy I take in either of these passages in isolation, it is as nothing compared to the idiot bliss I derive from their juxtaposition. Taken together, they ideally illustrate the two extremes of the great man’s voice: on the one hand, its glowing beauty and spacious sonority; on the other, its anfractuous density and heedless flamboyance. 

One really would have to have a miserly spirit not to love both. Browne’s prose is a magnificent Baroque palace, by dizzying turns grandiose or lyrical, opulent or elegant, monstrous or precious, inordinate or harmonious, carelessly vast or pedantically exact—and always magnificent. All its outlandish and scintillating mannerisms are just so many volutes and modillions, Solomonic columns and gilded cornices, quadrature and mirrored halls. And all of it is a monument to a brief enchanted period in the seventeenth century when English had achieved the whole range of its expressive powers, and when its greatest writers were not yet burdened by any bad conscience about employing those powers to their fullest. Never again would English letters enjoy such a state of innocent sophistication (or sophisticated innocence).

And yet, of course, it was also the age of the King James Bible, which is so often praised for exhibiting precisely the opposite virtues: simplicity, clarity, plain diction. All of which is true enough, admittedly: the King James is perhaps the greatest feat of pellucid phrasing in the history of English letters. But is that the whole story?

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity. " --Ecclesiastes

This, from Ecclesiastes, is definitely a grand and gradual music, luminously clear in many respects; but it is not exactly austere; it is also quite complex in its cadences and syntax. True, its gleaming paratactic flow contrasts strikingly with Browne’s massy hypotactic architectonics. And yet the difference is nowhere near so absolute as one might initially be tempted to think. Read once again the first few sentences of the passage from “On Dreams” above. When one places the King James alongside the prose not only of Browne but of all the great English writers of the period, over a period of a few generations—John Florio (1552–1625), Lancelot Andrewes (1555–1626), John Donne (1572–1631), Robert Burton (1577–1640), Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), Izaak Walton (1593–1683), John Dryden (1631–1700), Thomas Traherne (c. 1636–1674), Joseph Addison (1672–1719), and so on—one cannot help but feel that one is moving back and forth along a single continuum: running not, as we tend to think of it today, from the gaudily ostentatious to the unpretentiously plain, but rather from the beautiful to the sublime, in the classical, pre-Kantian sense of those terms. Taken in that way, the “beautiful” is a style that abounds in sparkling ornamentation while the “sublime” is a style of majestic restraint, pitched “below the threshold” (sub limine) of the temple, a plangent bareness whose rhetorical power somehow exceeds that of the most spectacular oratorical adornments.

Every great national prose, in just about any tongue, reaches its high meridian only by way of a prolonged and constant negotiation of just this tension between beauty and sublimity—between the decorative and the august, or between the splendid and the lucid. And this comes only at the end of long epochs of development. To be able to balance expressiveness and reticence, or to know when to cast that balance away, requires tact and ingenuity and taste on the part of writers; but it also requires a language of sufficient maturity. This is why prose of any consequence invariably arrives far later in a culture’s history than does great poetry. Poetry entered the world almost as early as words did; it is the first flowering of language’s intrinsic magic—its powers of invocation and apostrophe, of making the absent present and the present mysterious, of opening one mind to another. It comes most naturally to languages in their first dawn, when something elemental—something somehow pre-linguistic and not quite conscious—is still audible in them. Prose, however, evolves only when that force has been subdued by centuries upon centuries of refinement, after unconscious enchantment has been largely mastered by conscious artistry, and when the language has acquired a vocabulary of sufficient richness and a syntax of sufficient subtlety, and has fully discovered its native cadences. In English, as in French, this happened in the early modern period, beginning in the late fifteenth century and reaching an unsurpassable zenith in the seventeenth. 

By then, moreover, English had amassed the most varied, magnificently farraginous hoard of words in any European tongue, full of Teutonic thunder and purling Latinity, but also enriched with every other verbal plunder it could seize from abroad. No other language could achieve so deep a range of organ-tones, or boast so enormous a collection of pipes and stops, or command so huge an acoustic space. Certainly no other could have produced the sort of wild polyphony and gorgeously wanton dissonances one hears in Macbeth’s

Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood

Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather

The multitudinous seas incarnadine,

Making the green one red.

This is the peculiar genius of the English language: this clash and chaos of radically different tones and textures, and this inexhaustible store of ever more exotic words, with all their ever finer distinctions of association and connotation.

All the great prose stylists of the next couple centuries of English letters would avail themselves freely of this extraordinary instrument’s capacities. Fashions would shift over time. The sensibility of the eighteenth century for a time moved more toward the Latinical registers, that of the nineteenth for a time more toward the Anglo-Saxon; but in every generation writers of any significance understood the magnitude of the musical forces at their disposal. And—well, here, take a typical passage from Thomas De Quincey in Confessions of an English Opium-Eater:

The ocean, in everlasting but gentle agitation, and brooded over by a dove-like calm, might not unfitly typify the mind and the mood which then swayed it. For it seemed to me as if then first I stood at a distance, and aloof from the uproar of life; as if the tumult, the fever, and the strife, were suspended; a respite granted from the secret burthens of the heart; a sabbath of repose; a resting from human labours. Here were the hopes which blossom in the paths of life, reconciled with the peace which is in the grave; motions of the intellect as unwearied as the heavens, yet for all anxieties a halcyon calm: a tranquillity that seemed no product of inertia, but as if resulting from mighty and equal antagonisms; infinite activities, infinite repose. 

I do not know exactly why, in the twentieth century, the dominant fashions in English prose moved relentlessly in the direction of ever greater simplification and aesthetic minimalism. I do not even entirely regret it. Tastes change, and some of the change has been a corrective of certain excesses of the past. But, on the whole, the result has been a kind of official dogma in favor of a prose so denuded of nuance, elegance, intricacy, and originality as to be often little better than infantile, not only in vocabulary but also in artistry and expressive power—a formula, that is, for producing writers whose voices are utterly anonymous in their monotonous ordinariness. Most of the fiction one reads today in literary journals is atrociously written, as are most of the essays, principally because writers have been indoctrinated in a style so rigid, barren, brutal, dry, and idiotically naïve that the best it can elicit from them is competent dullness. And who can tell one author from another?

Simplicity is difficult, after all, no less than complexity. Both require taste and skill. Neither is less artificial or more natural than the other. Both are necessary for good writing. And when either becomes a forced regimen, exclusive of the other, the results can be only hideous. Good writing is produced not by forsaking the beautiful for the sublime or the exorbitant for the restrained, but by finding new ways of orchestrating the interplay between them. Now, all the authorities of the age seem to concur, the literary performer should treat the organ’s console as a collection of decadent temptations to be resisted; he or she should confine the performance to a single manual, played with two fingers, with no stops pulled and the pedals never so much as brushed by an errant shoe-tip.

The Exemplars

I could, had I but world enough and time, fill volumes with passages from hundreds of masters of English prose to illustrate my notion of what the best writing looks and sounds like. Here, though, I have chosen five authors whose writing I especially love. To keep myself from expressing too much of my own idiosyncratic tastes, however, I have in each case reproduced a passage that I know others have also praised and excerpted in the past. I will add only that, if you wish for an accelerated tutelage in good writing, you could do far worse than to take these five for your teachers. 

Robert Louis Stevenson:

It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-colored pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapors; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the black end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde)

Sylvia Townsend Warner:

It was not beauty at all that she wanted, or depressed though she was, she would have bought a ticket to somewhere or other upon the Metropolitan railway and gone out to see the recumbent autumnal graces of the country-side. Her mind was groping after something that eluded her experience, a something that was shadowy and menacing, and yet in some way congenial; a something that lurked in waste places, that was hinted at by the sound of water gurgling through deep channels and by the voices of birds of ill-omen. Loneliness, dreariness, aptness for arousing a sense of fear, a kind of ungodly hallowedness—these were the things that called her thoughts away from the comfortable fireside. (Lolly Willowes)

J.A. Baker:

The valley sinks into mist, and the yellow orbital ring of the horizon closes over the glaring cornea of the sun. The eastern ridge blooms purple, then fades to inimical black. The earth exhales into the cold dusk. Frost forms in hollows shaded from the afterglow. Owls wake and call. The first stars hover and drift down. Like a roosting hawk, I listen to the silence and gaze into the dark. (The Peregrine)

Patrick Leigh Fermor:

Scattered with poppies, the golden-green waves of the cornfields faded. The red sun seemed to tip one end of a pair of scales below the horizon, and simultaneously to lift an orange moon at the other. Only two days off the full, it rose behind a wood, swiftly losing its flush as it floated up, until the wheat loomed out of the twilight like a metallic and prickly sea. (Between the Wood and Water)

Vladimir Nabokov: 

I recall one particular sunset. It lent an ember to my bicycle bell. Overhead, above the black music of telegraph wires, a number of long, dark-violet clouds lined with flamingo pink hung motionless in a fan-shaped arrangement; the whole thing was like some prodigious ovation in terms of color and form! It was dying, however, and everything else was darkening, too; but just above the horizon, in a lucid, turquoise space, beneath a black stratus, the eye found a vista that only a fool could mistake for the square parts of this or any other sunset. It occupied a very small sector of the enormous sky and had the peculiar neatness of something seen through the wrong end of a telescope. There it lay in wait, a family of serene clouds in miniature, an accumulation of brilliant convolutions, anachronistic in their creaminess and extremely remote; remote but perfect in every detail; fantastically reduced but faultlessly shaped; my marvelous tomorrow ready to be delivered to me. (Speak, Memory)

The Rules

To propose a list of rules for writers is probably a very presumptuous thing to do. The only authority it can possibly have is one’s own example, and so offering it to the world is something of a gamble. One has to assume that one’s own writing is impressive enough to most readers to provide one with the necessary credentials for the task. If one is wrong on this score, issuing those rules will invite only ridicule. I mean, for goodness’ sake, Steven Pinker (of all people) published a book on style. How can anyone take that seriously? 

Not that being a good writer is a guarantee that one has any great gift for instructing others in the art. E.B. White was an absolutely splendid stylist; he produced a prose so limpid that he was able to fool even himself that it was a triumph of simple diction rather than of (as was actually the case) very subtle intricacy. But he was also the chief perpetrator of Strunk and White’s Elements of Style, by far the most influential and most pernicious book of its kind in English: a total congeries of fatuous advice and grammatical ignorance. Similarly, George Orwell was a perfectly competent (if rather boring) stylist; and yet his celebrated essay “Politics and the English Language,” which was intended as a rebuke of obscurantist jargon, endures now mostly as a manifesto of literary provincialism. Had either White or Orwell followed his own turgid counsels with any fidelity, neither would be nearly as fondly remembered as he is.

Anyway, taking all things into account, I offer the following only to those who like my writing, or who at least think it accomplished enough to make me a credible authority on these matters. These are, if nothing else, the rules to which I adhere and that best express my literary tastes. The first three arise, in fact, from my own direct encounters with editors and critics.

Vocabulary:

1. Always use the word that most exactly means what you wish to say, in utter indifference to how common or familiar that word happens to be. A writer should never fret over what his or her readers may or may not know, and should worry only about underestimating them. As Nabokov said, a good reader always comes prepared with a dictionary and never resents being introduced to a new term. I call this the “ultracrepidarian rule,” simply because an editor once tried unsuccessfully to dissuade me from writing about a certain “polemicist who stumbles across unseen disciplinary boundaries in an ultracrepidarian stupor.” The editor lost that argument because there is absolutely no other word in the English language that so exactly means what I wanted to say.

2. Always use the word you judge most suitable for the effect you want to produce, in terms both of imagery and sound, as well as of the range of connotations and associations you want to evoke. This I call the “hyaline rule” on account of a sentence that appeared in a book of mine entitled The Doors of the Sea: “At the shorelines, the lovely glistening hyaline waters were all at once polluted with the silt and débris and murk of the ocean’s bed, and rose with such terrifying suddenness that very few—even as far away as Sri Lanka—had sufficient time to flee.” An indignant reader complained that I might just as easily have used the word “glassy” instead, as any decent unpretentious soul would have done. But I had chosen “hyaline” for very particular reasons: it is a precise word, meaning “glassy” in the sense principally of crystalline translucency; it had exactly the right sound for the sentence—three syllables, the lovely long-i vowel sounds, the equally lovely liquid “l” and smoothly glistening “n,” all of which gave it a glassy and watery feel on the tongue; and it was the perfect word in the context of that book because it echoes the book of Revelation’s thalassa hyalinē, “the sea of glass like unto crystal” before God’s throne, as well as Milton’s “On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea . . .” Perhaps no reader is likely to be aware of all of that; but I knew what I was doing, and so any other word would have been a craven capitulation to the ordinary.

3. When the occasion presents itself for using an outlandishly obscure but absolutely precise and appropriate word, use it. I call this the “pogonotrophy rule,” because I once wrote a review in the Times Literary Supplement of a book by Rowan Williams, at that time Archbishop of Canterbury, after a dreadfully stupid journalist had suggested that his reputation as an intellectual was a consequence only of his lavish beard. This gave me an opportunity to use that wonderful word, which I had long been holding in reserve for just the proper moment. Such an opportunity would certainly have never come again; if I had let it pass unexploited, I should have carried the grief of it to my grave.

4. Never use a word simply because it is obscure, but never hesitate to use a word on account of its obscurity either. If you show off by being punctiliously precise, as per rule one above, all the grand rococo ornamentation you could ever wish for your prose will spring up all on its own.

5. Do not use a thesaurus. Lists of putative synonyms do not give you a sense of any word’s most proper meaning and use. If you are trying to recall a word you know that inexplicably refuses to surface in your memory, maybe you will find it in such a volume; and perhaps, if you happen to be writing humorous verse and have come up against an intractable problem of scansion, you might find something suitable there. Otherwise, learn the meanings and uses of words by reading widely (with that dictionary that Nabokov recommends within reach).

6. The exotic is usually more delightful than the familiar. Be kind to your readers and give them exotic things when you can. In general, life is rather boring, and a writer should try to mitigate that boredom rather than contribute to it.

Style:

7. Sometimes less is more. More often, more is more and less is less. Sometimes more is the very least one can do for one’s readers.

8. If you must choose between elegance and perfect clarity, allow yourself a period of decorously agonized indecision, and then always choose elegance.

9. Never squander an opportunity for verbal cleverness. I once related in print the notorious tale of Schopenhauer throwing an old washerwoman down a flight of stairs, describing him at one point as seizing her by her “wizened weasand.” Self-indulgent, no doubt, but such moments as those make one feel that one has lived to a purpose.

10. In “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell proposes six rules, the first of which is a sound admonition against using hackneyed metaphors, but the second of which is “Never use a long word when a short one will do.” This is an idiotic maxim, one that concentrates almost every kind of philistinism in itself. What he should have written was “Never prefer a short word because it is short or a long word because it is long, but always use the word that to your mind best combines sense, felicity, connotation, wit, and sound, without worrying about whether your readers are likely to recognize it.”

11. Orwell also decrees: “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.” No great writer in the history of any tongue has ever observed this rule, and no aspiring writer should follow it. The correct counsel would be “If a word is so excessive as to mar the effect of a sentence, remove it; but never remove a word simply because it is possible to do so.”

12. Orwell then commands: “Never use the passive where you can use the active.” This is perhaps the worst rule of style ever proposed by anyone. All of literary history proclaims its imbecility. Instead: “Avoid the passive voice when the active works better and vice versa.” After all, in life we sometimes act and sometimes are acted upon. The causal dialectic between agency and patiency, to use the scholastic terms, is intrinsic to finitude.

13. Orwell’s next dictate is “Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.” All that can be salvaged from this trite and parochial balderdash is “Avoid jargon.” Feel free to use a foreign phrase when it is apt or pleasing to do so, and always do so when it expresses an idea with greater elegance or aphoristic economy than any English equivalent could (for instance, the phrase l’esprit d’escalier). English is a gloriously mongrel tongue, and it has always pillaged other languages for glittering trinkets. Moreover, always—always—employ precise scientific terms in contexts where they are germane.

14. Orwell’s final injunction is “Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.” Since, however, following his rules would produce barbarous prose roughly half the time, he ought instead to have written, “Ignore these rules, except for the one about hackneyed metaphors and the bit about jargon.”

15. Strunk and White’s Elements of Style decrees: “Keep related words together.” This is vacuous. Awkward ruptures of sense are obviously to be avoided. Taken as a principle, however, this little axiom is not only bad advice; it is a renunciation of language as such. As any decent student of linguistics knows, one of the chief differences between actual linguistic meaning (on the one hand) and mere ostensive noises and gestures (on the other) is its reliance upon structural rather than spatial proximities. The capacity to qualify a predicative phrase by the interpolation of a subordinate clause (for example) is one of those precious attainments that distinguish us from baboons.

16. The same book advises: “Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs.” That is moronic. Better not to write at all than attempt to heed so obscene a piece of puritanical nonsense. Write with every kind of word that serves your ends.

17. In fact, if you own a copy of The Elements of Style, just destroy the damned thing. It is a pestilential presence in your library. Most of the rules of style it contains are vacuous, arbitrary, or impossible to obey, and you are better off without them in your life. And the materials on grammar and usage are frequently something worse. Some of them are simply inherited fake rubrics—“however” must always be a postpositive, “which” must not be used for a restrictive relative clause, and other nonsense of that kind—all of which are belied by the whole canon of English literature. Others, however, are evidence of surprising ignorance. It is bad enough that the manual insists that one must on principle prefer the passive to the active voice; but it is far worse that it then adduces several supposed examples of sentences in the passive voice that are in fact nothing of the sort. One of them—“There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground”—seems to have been chosen simply because “lying” about sounds like a passive sort of thing to do. That neither Strunk nor White knew the difference between a passive construction and an active intransitive verb in the imperfect past tense—or, as the book also demonstrates, the difference between the passive and an active past perfect, or the difference between the passive and an adjectival past participle without an auxiliary verb—is genuinely shocking. It does, however, impart a useful lesson: never mistake a tone of authority for evidence of actual expertise.

18. All these vapidly doctrinaire injunctions—urging you to write only plain declarative sentences stripped of modifiers and composed solely of words familiar to the average ten-year-old and demanding that you always prefer charcoal-gray to sumptuous purple—are expressions of everything spiritually deadening about late modernity and its banausic values. They reflect an epoch in which the mysterious, the evocative, and the beautifully elliptical have been systematically suppressed and nearly extinguished in the name of the efficient, the practical, the mechanical, and the starkly unambiguous—in short, in the name of everything that makes existence uninviting and life boring. They are reflections of an age of bloodless capitalist economism, the reign of brutally common sense, the barbarian triumph of function over form, a spare, Spartan civic architecture of featureless glass and steel and plastic, a consumerist society that lives on the ceaseless production and disposal of intrinsically graceless conveniences. Learn to detest all of these things and you will be a better writer for having done so.

19. Always read what you have written aloud. No matter how elaborate your prose, it must flow; it must feel genuinely continuous. This is not to say one must imitate natural speech; it is only to say that one must try to capture its rhythms. If what you have written is awkward on your tongue, then it is awkward on the page.

Models: 

20. Bad writing is rarely mistaken for good by the discerning, but it can often be mistaken for great. Keep this in mind when considering the work of authors you are tempted to emulate.

21. Truly great writing is often inimitable, simply because the better a writer is, the more distinctive his or her voice tends to be. Keep this also in mind when considering the work of authors you are tempted to emulate.

22. If you have ever taken a course in “creative writing,” try to remember as vividly as possible the kind of prose you were encouraged by your teacher to write, and then do your very best to avoid writing that way. 

23. If you were told in school that Hemingway’s Old Man and the Sea is a specimen of good writing, disabuse yourself of this folly. It is in fact an excruciating specimen of bad schoolboy prose, written by a man who by that point had, alas, been too often drunk, too often concussed, and too often praised.

24. For American writers in particular, and especially young American writers, and most especially young male American writers: There is on these shores an indigenous tradition of the “American Sublime”—though in many cases it might better be called “American Fustian.” One encounters it at its worst in William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe when they are at their worst, as well as in a number of other authors whose names I here omit. We as a people like to strive for grand effects, often vastly in excess of any plausible occasion for doing so. Whether this is because of the presence of our magnificent landscape or because of the absence of a long cultural history I cannot guess. I would not say that you must resist the lures of this style altogether. It is there also to be found in the best of our literature—in Melville and Emerson, Muir and Thoreau, and so on—and there it is often glorious. Still, yield to it only to the degree that you can control the forces you set loose. Otherwise, you will lapse into inadvertent parody.

Punctuation:

25. A writer who disdains the semicolon is a fool. In fact, hostility to this most delicate and lyrical of punctuation marks is a sure sign of a deformed soul and a savage sensibility. Conscious life is not a brute concatenation of discrete units of experience; it is often fluid, resistant to strict divisions and impermeable partitions, punctuated by moments of transition that are neither exactly terminal nor exactly continuous in character. Meaning, moreover, is often held together by elusive connections, ambiguous shifts of reference, mysterious coherences. And art should use whatever instruments it has at its disposal to express these ambiguous eventualities and perplexing alternations. To master the semicolon is to master prose. To master the semicolon is to master language’s miraculous capacity for capturing the shape of reality.

26. Second only to the semicolon in subtlety, fluent beauty, and whimsy is the dash. Cherish it. Use it with abandon.

Readers:

27. Those who read only to be informed and never to delight in the words on the page have every right to do so. But do not write for them.

28. The only book reviewers of any significance are themselves distinguished writers. Cultivate critical intelligence in yourself and try to read your own work with impartiality; but studiously ignore criticism from the unaccomplished.

29. Do not write down to what you presume to be the level of your readers (unless you are writing specifically for very small children). To do so is an injustice both to them and to you. Even if your suppositions regarding them are correct, you should do them the honor of assuming they know what you know, or can learn it, or are at least willing to try. True, some readers become indignant at their own inability to follow prose of any complexity or to recognize words any more obscure than those they are accustomed to using when talking to their dogs. Invariably they will blame the author rather than themselves. You owe them absolutely nothing. If you attempt always to descend to the lowest common denominator, you will never hit bottom, but you will certainly end up losing the interest of better readers. Ours is, sadly, an age of declining literacy and attention spans, and the situation grows worse by the year. You simply must not make any concessions to that reality, unless you are prepared in the end to give up on writing altogether. 

The Last Things:

30. Memento mori. One day you will die and go to your long home and your voice will fall silent. You have only so much time to make the treasures of your mind and soul manifest. Do not waste the little span allotted to you producing only work intended for the moment rather than for posterity.

31. Know the names of things and the names of places. Both are a kind of poetry and both contain mysteries. It is an ancient intuition that to possess something’s proper name is to possess power over it; it is, if nothing else, to share in that thing’s form—its unique manner, that is, of making being’s inexhaustible richness manifest. This is because language is magic.

32. Language is magic. It is invocation and conjuration. With words, we summon the seas and the forests, the stars and distant galaxies, the past and the future and the fabulous, the real and the unreal, the possible and the impossible. With words, we create worlds—in imagination, in the realm of ideas, in the arena of history. With words, we disclose things otherwise hidden, including even our inward selves. And so on. When you write, attempt to weave a spell. If this is not your intention, do not write.

33. As you near your life’s end, you will be able to look back over your work with some satisfaction if there have been moments in your prose when you have achieved precisely what you hoped to achieve. Keep an inventory of these in your mind, so that you can return to them when you find yourself depressed, uninspired, or suffering self-doubt. I offer two of my own such moments in parting, not because either is in any sense the best thing I have written, but only because each happened (almost miraculously) to have exactly the form and effect that I wanted it to have before I began to write it. 

The first is not even a complete sentence, but only a sequence of fragmentary impressions in a story called “A Voice from the Emerald World”:

The light, palely golden in the fluttering leaves, and between the slowly swaying culms . . . and, when I look up, that great eye of soft luminous blue, fringed by the mercurial sparkle of green and silver leaves . . . that blank, quietly menacing, mysterious gaze . . . .

The second is a short passage from near the end of a novel entitled Kenogaia:

He could even see Kenopolis from here, no longer under a pall of storm-clouds, ringed by the mild aqueous shimmer of the moonlit harbor and bay and sea; now, though, it all looked poignantly diminutive, like a chaotically turreted sandcastle among shallow tidal pools, waiting for the rising surf to break it down, or like a frayed cardboard diorama in a neglected corner of the nursery. Why, he mused, had they ever felt it necessary to flee from something so quaint and ephemeral?

Only I can ever really know what it is about each of them that I find so perfectly pleasing; but, believe me, that knowledge makes all the hard work of writing seem more than worthwhile.

## Addendum 1: **LEXICON & DICTION STRATEGY** of James Rother

---

*PROBLEM*: I noticed that the other thing we are fighting with the AI engagement model is the limited vocabulary.   Rother typically,  on the contrary,  selects words from a much larger vocabulary,  and he does it on purpose to throw up barriers to overcome and to more accurately render what he wants to in the prose.  Please write an addendum to Velvet as a markdown strategy prompt to fully employ Rother's rich vocabulary.

*SOLUTION*: *A drop-in strategy prompt to unlock Rother’s fuller vocabulary without sliding into purple pastiche. Paste into your system/style block above content prompts.*

---

### Operating Principle

Prefer **precision over ornament** and **register contrast over sludge**. Rother’s richness isn’t thesaurus cosplay; it’s *controlled specificity* that makes the mechanism legible.

---

### Dial Settings

* **Baroque Intensity:** low / **medium** / high
* **Register Mix (Anglo-Saxon : Latinate):** **60 : 40** (verbs punch, nouns carry weight)
* **Neologism Budget:** 0–1 per 300 words
* **Rare-Term Quota:** 3–6 per 250 words (spaced; never clumped)
* **Metaphor Budget:** ≤2 per piece

---

### Selection Rules (the “Why this word?” test)

1. **Name the mechanism.** Choose terms that reveal action: *launder, occlude, ventilate, deputize, amortize, suture*.
2. **Govern the register.** Saxon verbs (cut, scorch, blunt) + Latinate nouns (annuity, diktat, suasion) = torque.
3. **Define by proximity.** When deploying a rare term, add a **micro-gloss**: apposition or em-dash clause in ≤6 words.
4. **Kill sludge.** Ban: *synergy, leverage (verb), robust, next-gen, unlock, game-changer, world-class, cutting-edge, paradigm, utilize, empower*. Substitute with concrete actions.
5. **No synonym bingo.** One precise word beats a string of near-synonyms.

### Rother’s Working Lexicon (curated, non-exhaustive)

**Mechanism Verbs:** lacerate, cauterize, lacquer, launder, occlude, ventilate, deputize, conscript, amortize, arbitrage (v.), underwrite, suture, vitrify, domesticate, ritualize, anneal, expropriate.

**Power & Governance:** diktat, praetorian, sinecure, suasion, rent-seeking, mandarin, chancery, fiat, covenant, consent decree, annuity, carry, duration, clawback.

**Failure & Fragility:** friable, tendentious, operose, ersatz, brittle, deranged, profligate, parochial, venal, derisory.

**Epistemic & Rhetorical:** catechetical, ex cathedra, apologia, catechresis, palimpsest, glossolalic, teleology, hermeneutic, periodic sentence, volta.

**Techno-Critic’s Toolkit:** demo theater, inevitability theater, compliance upholstery, telemetry, provenance, gradient, exfiltrate, watermark, entropy budget, error budget.

> **Note:** Favor *one* term per cluster; contextualize on first use.

---

### Register Mixer (quick swaps)

* **use** → wield, apply, deploy
* **seems** → appears in [metric/context]; **ban hedgy free-floaters**
* **speed** → tempo, cadence, throughput
* **change** → refactor, revise, recompose
* **move fast** → accelerate the cadence; compress the interval

---

### Braiding Receipts (Harris-isms, not listicles)

Embed public facts **inside** clauses; avoid bulletized evidence.

* “After **‘AI Mondays’** and the **~80% cut (Q1’23)**, the shop boasts **~75% margins**, which—absent defect baselines—reads like **survivorship in a tuxedo**.”

**Receipts =** specific numbers, dated events, attributed quotes, filings/changelogs—anything that would alter the conclusion if false.

---

### Syntax Pattern (use once per piece)

**Periodic with volta:**

> “The memo praises acceleration in every register—product, headcount, even apology cycles—**until** the unpriced costs (rework, incidents, attrition) surface like sediment in a glass.”

Follow with a **staccato dagger:**

> “Speed is easy. Recovery is expensive.”

---

### Micro-Prompts (drop-in switches)

* `Lexicon::Tighten(3 rare terms; gloss inline; space them)`
* `Register::AngloVerb_LatinNoun()`
* `Receipts::Braid(2 facts, 1 quote)`
* `Hedges::Purge(except when paired with metric)`
* `Metaphor::Limit(2; kill extended conceits)`

---

### Quality Gate (before you ship)

* **Rare-term spacing** passes (no clusters)?
* **One emblematic image** early, then stop?
* **Counterfactual ledger** named (defects, rework, incidents, quality delta)?
* **Aphoristic coda** indicts systems, not people?

---

### Mini Demonstration (neutral topic)

**Example 1**
Plain: *The product seems innovative but may have issues with accuracy and costs a lot to run.*
Rother-ized: *The demo dazzles, but the system **launders** error as fluency and **amortizes** truth into throughput—an innovation whose **carry** is paid in rework.*

**Example 2**
Plain: *Preparation for the upcoming DR has turned into a full-blown migration exercise,  starting now.*
Rother-ized: *Disaster-recovery “prep” has sloughed off its euphemism and revealed itself as a wholesale migration: environments uprooted, data in flight, cutovers rehearsed as liturgy—effective immediately. The drill is over; the convoy rolls. Contingency has become mandate, and the timetable is not negotiable. Pack light; there will be no return this time.*

---

**Bottom line:** Rother’s vocabulary is a **tool of diagnosis**, not decoration; choose words that **pin the mechanism to the page**, braid receipts into the clausework, and close on a line that feels like a verdict rather than a vibe.
