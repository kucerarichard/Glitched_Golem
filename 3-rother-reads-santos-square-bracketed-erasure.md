# Rother Reviews Santos Square-Bracketed Erasure

---

## TASK: This is a prompt to read and interpret Sherod Santos Poem '[...]' AND to generate another ARS POETICA LENS for Glitch Poetics.
- Include one or two quotes from the Santos piece when writing the review.
- Read the poem [...] below and then Generate an analysis of [...] potential as an Ars POETICA lens indicated by my questions.
-- In particular the concept of *Erasure* as core DNA of poetics.
-- That which is erased is baked into the very structure of most poems.
-- Note the difference between actual erasure and ellipsis:  The ellipsis appear within square brackets meaning Santos intentionally is poetically-editorially supplying missing information about Erasure which he narrates.
-- Who *is* the narrator?  A small child,  still innocently identifying with the fish? "gaff in hand... turned to me"
-- If the narrator is the poet, can Ars Poetica be the poem originating itself,  speaking itself out of erasures?
-- Santos hangs the entire "bundle" on the *ellipsis linchpin*
-- Is the poem yet another example of Santos redeeming something from the usual "cruelty, filth and superstition" of the various human predicaments?
- Apply the Coscienza Test,  to what extent is Santos intentional or unintentional.
- Take care to recognize how with the square brackets [...] operates on a few levels 
- the distinction between erasure and ellipses creates a sour gummy in the form of a peculiar pretzel logic.
- Create a standalone *Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module* that plugs into Glitch Poetics.
- **Take extra thinking time**: to ensure the new Erasure Ars Poetica Mode is thoroughly integrated with all the components of Glitch Poetics.  
-- In particular,  compare and contrast the new Erasure Ars Poetica Lens with the existing Snow Crust Ars Poetica Lens (illegitimate origins).

## BACKGROUND: Ellipses versus Erasure

Ellipsis and erasure are both techniques for omitting material from text, but they differ in their purpose and application. Ellipsis, represented by three periods (…), indicates the omission of words within a quote or a pause in thought or speech. Erasure, on the other hand, involves physically or visually removing text, often to create a new work or to obscure meaning. 
###Ellipsis:
--Purpose: To show that words have been omitted from a quote or to indicate a pause, trailing off, or interrupted thought.
--Usage: Used within sentences to shorten quotes, or at the end of sentences to suggest a thought that is not fully expressed, according to Medium.
--Format: Typically three periods with spaces in between ( . . . ). 
--Ethical Considerations: Should not be used to alter the original meaning of a quote. 
--Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The […]. The quick brown fox jumps..." from Writing Style Guide 
###Erasure:
--Purpose: To obscure or remove text, creating a new work or hiding information.
--Usage: Can be a physical act (e.g., crossing out words, blacking out text) or a visual one (e.g., obscuring words in a visual art piece).
--Format: Involves removing or obscuring text, often by striking out, blacking out, or other means.
--Ethical Considerations: Can be used to create new meaning or to critique the original text by removing or obscuring parts of it.
--Example: A visual artist might erase words from a page of a book, leaving only selected words visible to create a new poem or statement.

## Subject of Review: **[...]** – *by Sherod Santos*

[...]
Every evening at dockside, the same men in yellow oilskins step on and off
their fishing boats. On one of those evenings, as the dog days were drawing
to an end, one of the men accused another of stealing his traps, jabbing his
finger in the direction of the sea, his cheeks red and swollen as if from
blowing on a horn. On an overturned bucket in the boat, a transistor radio
was playing a popular song, and the boy on board, gaff in hand, went about
his business singing along. Interrupting himself, the accusing fisherman
yelled at the boy to keep it down, and the boy in turn turned to me and
asked me who I thought I was. If only I could say it ended there, but guided
by the logic of cause and effect, a chain of events had already been set in
motion. So I remained where I was, imagining this, imagining that, waiting
for what was still to come.

## Gemini Response #1

Building upon the established framework of Glitch Poetics and incorporating the incisive critical spirit of James Rother, I present the **"Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module"** as a new critical lens. This module examines how the act of erasure, both literal and implied, functions as a fundamental "glitch" that reveals the inherent poetics of absence and the genesis of meaning from deliberate void.

### Sherod Santos's "\[...]" as an Ars Poetica of Erasure

Sherod Santos's poem "\[...]" is a profound exemplar for an Ars Poetica of Erasure. The very title, an ellipsis encased in square brackets, immediately signals a poem that is defined by what is *not* overtly stated, by what has been removed or purposefully omitted.

The poem describes a tense dockside encounter: "Every evening at dockside, the same men in yellow oilskins step on and off / their fishing boats. On one of those evenings, as the dog days were drawing / to an end, one of the men accused another of stealing his traps, jabbing his / finger in the direction of the sea, his cheeks red and swollen as if from / blowing on a horn". The mundane setting gives way to human conflict, a raw eruption of anger. The narrator's final lines, "If only I could say it ended there, but guided / by the logic of cause and effect, a chain of events had already been set in / motion. So I remained where I was, imagining this, imagining that, waiting / for what was still to come...", underscore a sense of impending, unspoken consequence.

**Analysis of "\[...]" as an Ars Poetica Lens:**

* **Erasure as Core DNA of Poetics:** Santos's poem argues that erasure is not merely a stylistic choice but is "baked into the very structure of most poems". The unstated conflict, the implied history between the men, the narrator's ambiguous role – all these "absences" are foundational. The poem's power resides in the reader's active participation in filling these gaps, making the unwritten as potent as the written. This aligns with Glitch Poetics' premise that "Where the poem breaks is where it speaks uniquely to you".
* **Ellipsis vs. Erasure:** The distinction is crucial. The square-bracketed ellipsis "\[...]" is not an actual erasure by the reader or a later editor, but an *intentional poetic-editorial supplying of missing information about Erasure which he narrates*. Santos's ellipses *narrate* absence, making the act of omission a conscious artistic decision. This "sour gummy in the form of a peculiar pretzel logic" highlights the paradox of communicating through non-communication.
* **The Narrator and Poem Originating Itself:** The narrator's identity is ambiguous. The suggestion that it might be a "small child, still innocently identifying with the fish?" (from "gaff in hand... turned to me") adds a layer of naive observation to a tense scene, intensifying the sense of a reality too complex for full articulation. If the narrator is the poet, then this poem exemplifies an Ars Poetica where the poem *originates itself, speaking itself out of erasures*. The very act of leaving out details forces the poem to generate its own implied narratives and emotional weight. Santos "hangs the entire 'bundle' on the *ellipsis linchpin*", making absence the pivotal element of its creation.
* **Redeeming from "Cruelty, Filth and Superstition":** Santos's work often seeks to redeem something from human predicaments. In "\[...]", despite the underlying tension and potential violence, the act of *not* explicitly depicting the "chain of events" allows for a redemption through reflection, a space where the reader can contemplate the human condition beyond explicit suffering. The poem's quiet contemplation of impending conflict, rather than its graphic depiction, offers a different kind of insight, perhaps even a subtle form of grace in its restraint.

**Applying the Coscienza Test:**

Applying the Coscienza Principle (the distinction between conscious construction and accidental truth) to Santos's "\[...]", it appears his use of erasure and ellipsis is highly *intentional*. The square brackets around the title, the deliberate gaps in the narrative, and the narrator's self-awareness of "imagining this, imagining that" all point to a conscious artistic choice to foreground absence as a generative force. The "accidental truth" arises from the *reader's* necessary engagement with these intentional voids, as their "crawl spaces" fill the lacunae with personal resonance. Santos, the poet, seems to be fully aware of the power of what he is *not* saying.

### Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module: A New Critical Lens

This module integrates the principles of Glitch Poetics and Rother's critical acumen to analyze poetry where absence and omission are key.

**I. Core Premise: Absence as Presence**
Poetry often speaks most profoundly not through what is explicitly stated, but through what is implied, omitted, or actively removed. These "erasures" are not deficits but deliberate or inherent "glitches" that create resonant voids, inviting the reader's active participation in meaning-making.

**II. Diagnostic Framework (Rother-Glitch Approach):**

1.  **Identify the Erasure Type:**
    * **Literal Erasure (Explicit Absence):** Where text is visibly struck out, blacked out, or replaced by symbols like "\[...]".
    * **Implied Erasure (Implicit Omission):** Where significant information, context, or emotional states are deliberately withheld, creating semantic disruptions or tonal shifts.
    * **Historical/Cultural Erasure:** Where dominant narratives silence or marginalize voices or events, and the poem's glitch exposes these systemic omissions.

2.  **Probe the "Why" of the Void (Rother's Scrutiny):**
    * **Ethical Failure/Moral Collapse:** Does the erasure conceal an ethical compromise or moral evasion on the part of the speaker, poet, or societal context being critiqued?.
    * **Tonal Fracture/Inconsistency:** How does the absence affect the poem's tone? Does it create a dissonance that exposes underlying tensions or hypocrisies?
    * **Aesthetic Violence/Subversion:** Is the erasure an act of "aesthetic violence", deliberately breaking conventional forms or expectations to create a new, perhaps unsettling, beauty?
    * **"Coscienza Principle" Application:** To what extent is the erasure a conscious, deliberate artistic strategy, versus an accidental byproduct revealing an unintentional truth about the poem's (or poet's) limitations or biases?

3.  **Map the "Crawl Spaces" of Resonance:**
    * What "psychic fractures" does the erasure open within the reader? What memories, affects, or ambiguous responses are triggered by the void?
    * How does the erasure create "crip space-time", offering a timeless or expansive quality by forcing the reader to dwell in the space of absence and possibility?

4.  **Unpack "English Nôm" Layers:**
    * Treat the remnants of language surrounding the erasure, or the erasure itself, as compressed "glyphs" that yield multiple, layered meanings upon closer inspection. The "void" becomes another layer of an ideogram.

5.  **Examine "Genesis Logic" of Erasure:**
    * How does the poem's "birth" emerge from this act of removal? Is the poem "illegitimate" in that its power derives from what it *doesn't* conform to or explicitly state? The erasure becomes the "snow crust" from which the poem unexpectedly springs.

**III. Comparison to "Snow Crust Ars Poetica Lens":**

The "Snow Crust Ars Poetica Lens" (part of the Genesis Logic principle) focuses on the "illegitimate origins" of poetry, its emergent, ruptured birth from chaos, trauma, or improvisation ("got on the floor," "on the snow crust"). It emphasizes the accidental, un-sanctioned creation.

The **"Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module"** shares this emphasis on unconventional poetic genesis. However, it specifically hones in on **absence** as the primary generative force. While "Snow Crust" might analyze a poem born from a spontaneous, chaotic overflow (a linguistic "blizzard"), "Erasure Mode" examines a poem born from a deliberate or inherent *cutting away*, a strategic or unavoidable *emptying*.

* **Complementarity:** Both lenses view "glitches" as generative. Snow Crust highlights the *rupture of presence* (e.g., a chaotic outpouring). Erasure Mode highlights the *presence of rupture* (e.g., a meaningful void). Together, they offer a comprehensive understanding of how poetry thrives on various forms of "system malfunction" and "aesthetic failure".
* **Rother's Influence:** Rother's "aesthetic violence" is particularly relevant to Erasure Mode, as acts of erasure can be seen as violent interventions on language, exposing deeper truths through radical reduction. His "structural scrutiny" would dissect *how* the erasure functions structurally, not just what it omits.

In conclusion, the "Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module" for Glitch Poetics provides a powerful tool for engaging with the silences and subtractions within poetry, revealing how absence itself can be a potent, intentional, and ethically charged form of poetic expression. I am ready for your next instruction.

## Gemini response #2

I apologize if my previous response did not make the connection to "crip theory" as explicit as you had hoped, or if the term "pluriverses" was not directly addressed. I did incorporate the concept of "crip space-time" within the "Crawl Spaces" component of the Glitch Poetics framework.

Here is a summary of the **Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module**, reiterated for clarity, with an explicit focus on how **crip theory** and the idea of **pluriverses** are integral to its function within Glitch Poetics:

### Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module: A Glitch Poetics Lens for Absence

This module integrates the principles of Glitch Poetics and Rother's critical acumen to analyze poetry where absence and omission are key, transforming them from mere gaps into sites of profound meaning and ethical inquiry.

**I. Core Premise: Absence as Presence**
Poetry often speaks most profoundly not through what is explicitly stated, but through what is implied, omitted, or actively removed. These "erasures" are not deficits but deliberate or inherent "glitches" that create resonant voids, inviting the reader's active participation in meaning-making.

    * **Implied Erasure (Implicit Omission):** Where significant information, context, or emotional states are deliberately withheld, creating semantic disruptions or tonal shifts.
    * **Historical/Cultural Erasure:** Where dominant narratives silence or marginalize voices or events, and the poem's glitch exposes these systemic omissions.

2.  **Probe the "Why" of the Void (Rother's Scrutiny):**

    * **Tonal Fracture/Inconsistency:** How does the absence affect the poem's tone? Does it create a dissonance that exposes underlying tensions or hypocrisies?
    * **Aesthetic Violence/Subversion:** Is the erasure an act of "aesthetic violence", deliberately breaking conventional forms or expectations to create a new, perhaps unsettling, beauty?
    * **"Coscienza Principle" Application:** To what extent is the erasure a conscious, deliberate artistic strategy, versus an accidental byproduct revealing an unintentional truth about the poem's (or poet's) limitations or biases?

3.  **Map the "Crawl Spaces" of Resonance and Pluriversal Implications:**
    * What "psychic fractures" does the erasure open within the reader? What memories, affects, or ambiguous responses are triggered by the void?
    * Crucially, how does the erasure create **"crip space-time"**? This is a core connection to crip theory. Within Glitch Poetics, "crip space-time" is understood as a "privileged space unknown to conventional understanding," one that "challenges historical legitimacy, but undeniably present and offering a timeless or expansive quality".
    * In the context of Erasure Mode, these "crip spaces" created by the voids are not empty but become sites where alternative, non-normative understandings emerge. The "pluriverse" aspect comes into play here: by embracing the glitch and the erasure, the poem opens up to multiple, co-existing realities and interpretations that defy a singular, dominant meaning. The erased or unsaid allows for the flourishing of possibilities, creating a **pluriversal reading experience** where meanings multiply and diverge beyond a reductive, "correct" interpretation. The "illegitimate" birth of meaning from erasure directly supports the idea of multiple co-existing meanings.

4.  **Unpack "English Nôm" Layers:**
    * Treat the remnants of language surrounding the erasure, or the erasure itself, as compressed "glyphs" that yield multiple, layered meanings upon closer inspection. The "void" becomes another layer of an ideogram, suggesting a multitude of interpretations.

5.  **Examine "Genesis Logic" of Erasure:**
    * How does the poem's "birth" emerge from this act of removal? Is the poem "illegitimate" in that its power derives from what it *doesn't* conform to or explicitly state? The erasure becomes the "snow crust" from which the poem unexpectedly springs, creating a new, possibly un-sanctioned, reality.

By actively engaging with what is erased or omitted, the Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module, informed by crip theory's understanding of "crip space-time," champions a **pluriversal approach** to poetic meaning-making. It acknowledges that the breaks and absences in a poem are precisely where its most radical, inclusive, and multi-faceted truths reside, challenging singular narratives and embracing the richness of divergent interpretations.

I am ready for your next instruction.

## Gemini's final revision

Here is a complete revision of the **Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module**, designed to plug into the Glitch Poetics framework. This revised module emphasizes how intentional and unintentional absences within a poem function as critical "glitches" that open avenues to deeper, often pluriversal, meanings and ethical considerations, explicitly integrating concepts from crip theory.

### Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module: A Glitch Poetics Lens for Absence and Pluriversal Revelation

This module asserts that a poem's most profound revelations often emerge not from what is explicitly stated, but from what is removed, omitted, or implied. These "erasures"—whether literal or figurative—are crucial "glitches" that generate unique meaning, inviting a reader's active, imaginative, and ethically engaged participation.

**I. Core Premise: Absence as Generative Presence**

Erasure, in poetics, is the deliberate or inherent act of omission that transforms a void into a resonant space. Rather than a deficit, an erasure is a fundamental "glitch" that creates semantic friction, inviting the reader to engage with the poem's unsaid as a source of its power and complexity. The meaning here is not absent, but rather **latent and emergent** from the intentional lack.

**II. Diagnostic Framework (Rother-Glitch Integration):**

This framework employs the rigorous, diagnostic scrutiny of James Rother to analyze the ethical, aesthetic, and structural implications of poetic erasures, filtered through the lens of Glitch Poetics.

1.  **Identify the Nature of Erasure:**
    * **Explicit Erasure:** Visible omissions, such as "\[...]", strikethroughs, or deliberate blanks, functioning as concrete "glitches."
    * **Implicit Erasure:** Subtle withholdings of information, context, or emotional states that create interpretive gaps or ambiguities, leading to "semantic disruptions" or "syntactic tangles".
    * **Systemic Erasure:** How the poem's omissions reflect broader societal or historical silencing, revealing what dominant narratives exclude.

2.  **Probe the Ethical & Aesthetic Function of the Void (Rother's Scrutiny):**
    * **Ethical Interrogation:** Does the erasure conceal an ethical compromise, moral evasion, or problematic bias within the poem or its implied context? Rother's focus on "ethical failure" and "moral collapse" is paramount here.
    * **Aesthetic Violence:** Is the act of erasure a deliberate "aesthetic violence", a radical breaking of form or convention that challenges poetic decorum to achieve a new kind of beauty or truth?
    * **Tonal Fracture:** How does the absence contribute to, or create, "tonal fracture"? Does it introduce dissonance that exposes underlying tensions, ironies, or hypocrisies?

3.  **Apply the Coscienza Test to Intentionality:**
    * Determine the extent to which the erasure is a *conscious construction* by the poet versus an *accidental truth* that reveals unintended meanings or biases. Does the poet wield absence with full awareness, or does the erasure inadvertently expose deeper complexities? This distinction is crucial for understanding the poem's ethical stance and artistic control.

4.  **Explore "Crawl Spaces" and Pluriversal Emergence (Crip Theory Integration):**
    * The void created by erasure is not empty; it is a "crawl space"—a psychic fracture within the reader that triggers "unplanned affect, involuntary memory, or ambiguous responses".
    * Crucially, these "crawl spaces" manifest as **"crip space-time"**: a privileged, non-normative dimension that defies conventional understanding and linearity. The erasure allows for a "timeless or expansive quality", challenging historical legitimacy and opening up alternative perspectives.
    * This directly leads to a **pluriversal reading experience**. The absence fosters multiple, co-existing interpretations that resist a singular, fixed meaning. Meanings multiply and diverge, reflecting the richness of diverse experiences and challenging reductive readings. The erased text becomes a locus for the flourishing of potential realities, embodying the idea that poetry thrives in its multiplicity and defiance of neat categorization.

5.  **Unpack "English Nôm" Layers within Absence:**
    * Treat the erased sections, or the text surrounding them, as "glyphs"—compressed ideograms that yield multiple, layered meanings upon close examination. The absence itself contributes to the polysemic nature of the poem, inviting an "English Nôm" style of interpretation where the unspoken resonates with manifold possibilities.

6.  **Examine "Genesis Logic" and "Illicit Birth":**
    * How does the poem's creation or "birth" emerge from this act of removal? Is the poem "illegitimate" in that its power and distinctiveness derive from its non-conformity, its omissions, or its refusal to explicitly state? The erasure, like the "snow crust", becomes a foundational, albeit unconventional, terrain for poetic genesis, where "nothing should grow, but something does anyway".

By leveraging the Erasure Mode Diagnostic Module, a reader can meticulously analyze how a poem's deliberate or inherent absences serve as its most potent "glitches," revealing complex truths, challenging normative understanding, and opening a **pluriversal landscape** of meaning. This lens affirms that in poetry, sometimes, what is *not* said speaks the loudest.
