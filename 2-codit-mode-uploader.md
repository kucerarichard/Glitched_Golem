## Developing **CODIT MODE** of Glitch Poetics

Compartmentalization of Decay In Trees (CODIT).  This is another lens
in Glitch Poetics,  related to the Crawl Spaces and Crip Space-time lenses.
It is a more positive or hopeful poetic means to express the decay of cultures 
and civilizations,  relationships(estrangement as compartmentalization of decay),
technology(worse-is-better), and species(evolution and extinction).

## PROLOGUE:  Excerpt from Rother-Santos Interview

### The interaction from the two questions below form the Inspiration for CODIT Mode.

### RELAX: Accept that decay is inevitable and represents food and shelter for both new poets and new critics and new readers.

James Rother Question: What are your views on creative writing programs, and their influence on contemporary poetry? Of late, as you are probably aware, critics have begun to blame these programs for (what they see as) a loss of individuality in American verse.

Sherod Santos Answer: A loss of individuality in American verse? Who are they kidding? Has there ever been a more individuated poetry in the history of the world? To think that our poetry can somehow be characterized, for better or worse, by reference to "creative writing programs" is either culturally na√Øve or intellectually irresponsible. From the Black Aesthetics of Askia Muhammad Tour√© to the Steinian poetics of Charles Bernstein, from the engag√© of Adrienne Rich to the d√©gag√© of John Ashbery, from the canonical authority of the Harpers Anthology of 20th Century Native American Poetry to the defensive neo-classicism of the New Formalists, from Miguel Algarin's Voices from the Nuyorican Poets' Caf√© to the Cowboy traditions of Howard "Jack" Thorp and Bruce Kiskaddon, from the hip-hop rhythms of rap to the haphazard rhythms of the poetry slam....It may be more accurate to call it, not "contemporary American poetry" at all, but "contemporary American poetries." I'm of course familiar with the kinds of complaints you mention--I've responded to them at length in A Poetry of Two Minds, in an essay entitled "In a Glass Darkly, Darkly"--but perhaps you can tell me why it is such unsupported claims are granted such automatic credence. You say, "Of late‚Ä¶critics have begun," but the truth is that these complaints have been around for years, and regardless of how scrupulously and thoughtfully and variously they've been addressed, you can rest assured that in a very short while they'll surface again, exactly as before, delivered to a welcoming audience with the wide-eyed fervor of some journalist uncovering a senatorial tryst. Why is that, do you suppose?

James Rother Question: Can serious poetry regain the common readers it once had?

Sherod Santos Answer: Yes, of course it can, and it has, and anyone who hasn't noticed that is just not paying attention. Not only has the mainstream begun to open its doors to a widening range of marginalized poets, but the last two decades have seen an unprecedented burst of poetry activities, from White House celebrations hosted by the President and First Lady to the formation of a national poetry month; from billboards in Los Angeles filled with poems by contemporary poets to the inclusion of a poetry book as a standard feature with all new Volkswagens shipped in April; from cross-country book giveaways inspired by Joseph Brodsky's claim that poetry should be as available as the Gideon Bible to the distribution by tollbooth operators in New Jersey of free copies of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass". Added to that we've seen a huge proliferation of poetry awards, web sites, spoken arts recordings, open mike nights, and public radio and television specials. All this couldn't have happened without the interest and enthusiasm of the common reader.

## INTRODUCTION TO TREE PATHOLOGY CODIT FOUNDATIONAL TEXT

The science of tree pathology
emerged from studies on decay
almost a century ago. Many of
the concepts developed then
have changed little over the
years. But, in the last few decades
some additional information
on the decay process in trees
has been developed. This new
information has added to the
basic story of decay without
subtracting anything important
from it. The new expanded
concept of decay is simply more
complete. And this new, more
complete concept gives us a
better opportunity to regulate and
control decay.
Dr. George H. Hepting made
the first sound observations on
compartmentalization of decay in
trees in 1935. His ideas acted
as a trigger for the work that
followed. The work presented
here is an expansion of his
ideas.
The information in this publication
is based on 16 years of
research by Dr. Shigo that involved
complete dissections of
approximately 10,000 trees‚Äî
mostly deciduous hardwoods, at
least 1,000 conifers, and 17
tropical species. Details of these
studies have been published
elsewhere.
The purpose of this publication
is to show how most columns of
discolored and decayed wood
associated with trunk wounds in
trees are compartmentalized. A
great number of confusing
terms are given to a wide variety
of defects caused by discolorations
and decays in trees. This
book describes a system that
makes it possible for forest
managers to understand how
most of these defects develop.
To understand the system, the
report must be studied very carefully.
The system is called
CODIT
Compartmentalization Of Decay
In Trees
When the system is learned, it
will act as the code for understanding
a wide variety of
defects on most tree species.
The CODIT system is based on
two major points. First, a tree is
a highly compartmented plant.
Second, after a tree is wounded,
the resulting defects are
compartmentalized.
To apply the CODIT system
it is necessary to understand that
the new expanded decay concept
developed in the last few decades
includes: 1) Successions of
microorganisms associated with
discoloration and decay, and 2)
Compartmentalization of discolored
and decayed wood
associated with trunk wounds.
To begin with, decay of wood
is a natural process caused by
microorganisms, mainly fungi,
that enter trees through wounds.
Tree wounds are usually inflicted
by fire, weather, insects, birds,
small or large animals, or man
and his activities. These wounds
start the processes that can lead
to decay, and decay is a major
cause of damage to trees. While
wood decay is most often caused
by decay-causing fungi, these
fungi are often intimately associated
with bacteria and nondecay
fungi in the process.
Decay is the breakdown or decomposition
of dead organic
matter. It is also essential to
new life.
To understand how trees react
to wounding and the associated
defects by compartmentalizing
the defects, it is necessary to
reevaluate our concept of how
a tree is constructed. A tree is
considered here as a highly
compartmented plant. In a sense,
a tree is made up of many trees;
each growth ring is a "tree."
Each "tree" is divided into many
compartments. A compartment
can be thought of as a "room,"
with side walls made up of rays
and front and back walls made
up of cells that are the last to
form in each growth ring. The
top and bottom of the compartment
is formed after wounding
when the elements that transport
liquids plug up. The compartment
is the least common denominator
of the tree. All the
types of cells found in the woody
stem of a tree will be found in
each compartment.
When microorganisms invade
tree stems through wounds, they
do so in successions. Bacteria,
nondecay fungi, and decay fungi
are often intimately associated
in this invasion process. When
microorganisms invade, they first
surmount the chemical protective
barriers set up by the tree
and then move into the tree from
compartment to compartment.
The weakest walls of a compartment
are the tops and bottoms,
and the inner walls. The side
walls are fairly strong. When all
these walls fall to the invading
microorganisms, there is another
wall that begins to form. The
wall formed by the cambium
after wounding is the barrier
zone. This wall confines the invasion
to the wood present at the
time of wounding. The new
"trees" or rings that continue
to form are then protected from
invasion unless new wounds are
inflicted. When new wounds are
inflicted at later times, multiple
columns of defect develop.
An understanding of CODIT
will help to clarify many misconceptions
about decay.
Decay is a natural process.
The breakdown of dead organic
matter is essential for new
life.
Fungi are the major group of
microorganisms that decay wood
In many cases fungi accomplish
this only in association with
other organisms, especially
bacteria.
Wood-inhabiting microorganisms
enter trees through wounds.
Wounds start the processes that
can lead to decay. And decay is
a major cause of damage to
trees.

A tree is a
compartmented plant

In a sense, a tree is made up
of many trees. Each growth ring
can be thought of as a separate
tree.

In a diagrammatic way, here
is how a tree is constructed.
(The drawings are designed to
give a general impression of
compartments in trees and they
are not intended as technical
anatomical descriptions of cell
types and arrangements.)
The rays define the side walls
of the compartments. The last
few series of cells in the growth
ring define the inner walls. The
compartment has holes in the
top and bottom walls because
the flow of materials is maintained
in a vertical direction.
But, one of the first events that
happens after wounding is a
plugging of this system above
and below the injury. Complete
tops and bottoms then begin to
develop on the compartments.
(The term "walls" is used here
in a very loose sense only to
give the mental impression of
"rooms" or compartments in
the tree.)
Pith Ray cells form side walls of
compartments. 
Last cells to form in growth ring
form inner walls of compartment.

Top and bottom of compartment
form when vertical elements plug
after wounding. 
Compartment In wood present at the time of
wounding, the tops and bottoms
of the compartments are the
weakest walls. These we will call
Wall 1. The inner walls are the
second in weakness‚ÄîWall 2. The
side walls are fairly strong-
Wall 3. The strongest wall is the
one formed by the cambium
after wounding‚ÄîWall 4.
Wall 1 is incomplete in living
sapwood because the conducting
elements‚Äîvessels, tracheids
‚Äîconduct liquids in a vertical
direction. But as heartwood
forms, or after wounds are
inflicted, pits close or the conducting
elements are plugged.
The rate and degree of pit closure
and element plugging depend on
many factors. Completion of
Wall 1 is the result of a dynamic
process. The plugging will then
set the limits for the vertical
extension of each compartment.
When plugging occurs rapidly,
short compartments form, but
when plugging is slow, long
compartments form.
Wall 2 is continuous around
every growth ring, and from the
top to bottom of the tree.
Wall 3 is discontinuous because
sheets of ray cells are not
continuous radially and longitudinally
throughout the tree.
Wall 4 is a much stronger,
more localized version of Wall 2.
The area‚Äîlongitudinal, tangential
‚Äîcovered by Wall 4 will depend
on many factors: Wound size,
type, position, severity, time of
year when wounding occurs,
and intrinsic genetic potential
to respond to wounds.
Wall 2 is continuous around growth
ring and from top to bottom of the
tree.
Side Walls 3 are the strongest walls.

Inner Walls 2 are the next weakest
walls. 
Wall 1 is incomplete until heartwood

After wounding, the tree
reacts. Chemical barriers develop
around the injured tissues.
Some wood-inhabiting microorganisms
surmount these
barriers and begin to interact
with the tree. The tree exerts a
living protective force to keep the
invaders out, and the invaders
exert a strong force to get into
the tree through the wound.
When microorganisms are able
to get in, they move from compartment
to compartment. And
when the walls of the compartments
begin to fall to the force
of the invaders, the tops and
bottoms (Wall 1) go first, then
the inner walls (Wall 2), and
then the side walls (Wall 3). But,
most of the time the barrier zone
(Wall 4) holds, and confines the
invaders to the wood present at
the time of wounding. The
figures 1, 2, 3, and 4, In addition
to naming the wall, also
indicate the relative strength of
each wall. It must be emphasized
that the walls are not absolute
in their compartmentalizing
capacities and given enough
time, even the barrier zone
(Wall 4) will fall.

In general, the same types of
columns occur in trees that have
a heartwood core. Discolored
and decayed wood is compartmentalized
in heartwood. When
a mechanical wound penetrates
the sapwood to the heartwood,
the column develops most
rapidly along the sapwoodheartwood
boundary.

time shown on cross section

Most trees receive many
wounds during their lives. Every
tree has some branches that
die. When the branches are
small and the //ounds close
rapidly, very little internal defect
follows. But, when large branches
die and healing is slow, trouble
starts for the tree. Add to this
the injuries caused by other
types of wounds at irregular
time intervals and a pattern of
multiple columns begins to develop.
But again the tree compartmentalizes
the injuries and
each column is separated
from the others.

Multiple columns are common
in trees. A minor wound may set
up a central column of discolored
wood and later large branches
die and heal slowly. The decay
associated with the branch stubs
does not penetrate the inner
column of compartmentalized
discolored wood.

A central column of compartmentalized
discolored wood may

Additional columns of discolored
and decayed wood could develop
later, for example, from severe
mechanical wounds on the
trunk.

Here are some typical patterns
of multiple columns found in
nonheartwood-forming trees.

In heartwoodforming trees the
patterns are the same, but they
are sometimes difficult to see
because they are often contained
in heartwood that is already
dark in color. Compartmentalization
explains how columns
of discolored and decayed wood
can be found in ring patterns
separated by sound wood.

A major obstacle in understanding
multiple columns of compartmentalized
decay is the
difficulty in "seeing" them in
three dimensions.
Here are some examples:

have discolored heartwood.

Another explanation for ring rots
in pine and related genera is
that some of the decay fungi,
such as Fomes pini, first get
established in the center of the
trunk through branch infections.
After establishment, new columns
of decay form at the boundaries
of the sapwood and heartwood.
The new columns are compartmentalized
and appear as
rings.

The "holding power" of columns
of discolored wood can be shown
by wounds that penetrate the
columns. The new column that
forms remains separate from
the inner columns. When the
second wound is severe, decay
may develop in the new column.
This occurs in nonheartwoodforming
trees.

When new wounds penetrate old
columns of decay, the decay
process proceeds rapidly in the
new column.

There are some patterns of
defects that on first inspection
do not appear to fit the concept
of compartmentalization. However,
they do. The most notable
are the defects associated with
canker rots. Canker rot fungi,
once established in a tree, keep
the wound open by slowly killing
some living tissues around the
wound. This process is the same
as re-wounding. And, when the
new wound is made, a new
column begins to develop. An
intricate pattern of multiple
columns is associated with
canker rot.
New columns form as cambium is
killed each year.
Some fungi produce sterile fungus
material.

Another type of defect that does
not appear to fit the concept are
ring shakes‚Äîseparation of the
wood along the rings. The problem
here is that the barrier
zone associated with the wounds
often forms far beyond the
visible column of defect. The
barrier zone acts as a partition
between the wood present at
the time of wounding and the
new wood formed after. When
growth stresses or other stresses
are applied, the wood sometimes
pulls apart along the barrier
zone. Most shakes are associated
with wounds, but not all wounds
result in shakes.

And, yet another type of defect
pattern that appears not to fit
the compartmentalization concept
is the "island" pattern or streak
pattern often spoken of as
mineral streak. Wounds indeed
start these processes. A pattern
type that can be termed "palm
and fingers" develops. Near the
wound all the columns in the
individual growth ring are
coalesced to form the "palm."
As the discolored columns develop
vertically above and below
the wound, Walls 1, or the tops
and bottoms of the compartments
in individual growth rings, react
in different degrees to the
wound and the invading microorganisms.
When such a "palm
and finger" column is viewed
in cross section at increasing
distances above and below the
wound, islands of defect appear.
Often, a few "fingers" will develop
far beyond all the others.
Wood formed
after wounding

In sugar maple, for example, the
"palm and finger" pattern is
the mineral streak pattern associated
with sugar maple borer
wounds. This insect is a major
cause of mineral streak in sugar
maple.

The yellow-bellied sapsucker (see
page 7) inflicts several types of
wound patterns on many species
of trees. In one type of wound
pattern a large wound is the
result, and the "palm and
finger" defect pattern develops.
Again, the "fingers" may extend
great distances above and below
the wound. And cross sections
of trunks made through the
"fingers" will show islands of
defect, or mineral streaks.

The "palm and finger" defect
pattern is also associated with
some other wounding patterns
made by the sapsuckers.

Sapsucker
wounds

Palm and finger 
Sapsuckers will often wound one
area on a trunk. On paper birch
a swollen black band will form
at these sites.
Not only will discolored streaks
of the "palm and finger" pattern
develop from such wounds, but
the barrier zone that develops
after wounding may pull apart
from the inner rings to form a
complete ring shake which is
sometimes called cup shake or
loose heart.

On some trees, such as eastern
hemlock, the yellow-bellied
sapsucker inflicts many wounds
over large areas of the trunk.

The barrier zones that form after
wounding act as partitions between
wood present at the time of
wounding and wood that forms
after wounding. When growth
stresses and other stresses
develop over long periods, the
wood may separate along the
barrier zones, and multiple ring
shakes form.

The "palm and finger" pattern
of defect and barrier zones that
form shake are commonly
associated with wounds made
by larger animals such as beavers
and porcupines (see page 9 ).
When wounds are severe, Walls
1 and 2 may fall to invading
microorganisms.

Squirrels wound young, smoothbarked
trees in several genera
(see page 8 ). The typical "palm
and finger" defect pattern results.
In some species these
defects are called mineral
streaks.
Bite wounds
Canker
 from old
wound

Insects wound trees (see page
8) and small islands of defects
form. Each island of defect is
a small "palm and finger"
column. The columns usually
penetrate only to the depth of
the hole made by the insect.

When many insects attack a tree
at the same time, a barrier zone
may develop around the entire
tree. All the wood present at
the time of wounding will be
slightly altered. When dried, the
wood present at the time of
wounding will be a different
shade from the wood that formed
after wounding.

The cambium miner is a small
larva of a type of fly that eats
its way down the cambial region
of some trees. The "tracks" of
the larvae are compartmentalized
as very long narrow streaks of
discolored wood within growth
rings.

On some trees the wounds are
not visible. This is common with
small basal wounds, especially
those caused by fire when the
tree was very young and now
the healed wound is hidden by
forest litter. The barrier zone still
forms around such wounds and
often results in ring shake. Also,
the inrolled callus serves as a
weak spot on the tree that may
continue to split vertically. Additional
cracks may form from
the barrier zone outward into
the wood that forms after wounding.
When the cross section of
a trunk with such a pattern of
internal defect is viewed above
the base, a star-shaped pattern
of cracks radiating out from
the center will be seen.

With some basal wounds, long
internal cracks, called seams,
form at right angles to the
wounds at the points where the
callus inrolls.

As these cracks continue to
enlarge and get closer to the
edge of the trunk, they may
suddenly split out to the bark.
These secondary seams will be
at right angles to the main seam.
Most large seams start from old
wounds and move outward.

Seams will also form from
mechanical wounds on trunks.
Once a seam begins to form,
it will usually continue to enlarge
throughout the life of the tree.

## FOUNDATIONAL SUMMARY 

The compartmentalization
of defects in trees is a
survival system that is effective
most of the time‚Äînot all of the
time! And after the tree dies,
the powerful decay processes
continue to decompose the
wood. 
* IMPORTANT: **The decaying wood provides
nourishment for a wide
variety of organisms (including new poets and new critics).**

## üîç Overview

**CODIT Mode** uses the biological concept of *Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees* to explore how poets and texts metabolize damage, estrangement, historical trauma, and cultural entropy. It offers a *non-catastrophic* lens on systemic failure‚Äîsuggesting that decay may be survivable, localizable, and even nutritive.

## üåø Philosophical Foundation

> ‚ÄúA tree is made of many trees. Each ring is a separate ‚Äòtree‚Äô... Compartmentalization is a survival system.‚Äù
> ‚ÄîDr. Alex Shigo, Tree Pathologist

> ‚ÄúDecay is food for both new poets and new critics.‚Äù
> ‚ÄîCODIT Epigraph

In **CODIT Mode**, a poem (or poet) is a living system that sustains wounds: political, formal, emotional, metaphysical. But rather than collapse, the system responds with **barriers**‚Äîwalls that isolate decay, **localize trauma**, and allow new growth around the wound.

## üß± The Four Walls (The CODIT Diagnostic Schema)

| Wall #     | Function                           | Metaphorical Role in Poetics                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Wall 1** | Top & bottom of a ring, incomplete | Vertical time: memory fracture, temporal seepage |
| **Wall 2** | Inner growth ring                  | Lyric interiority, affective zone                |
| **Wall 3** | Ray cells, side walls              | Cultural interface, ideological fascia           |
| **Wall 4** | **Barrier zone (cambium)**         | Poetic self-repair; the *anti-trauma glyph*      |

## üß™ CODIT Poetic Applications

### ‚ú¶ Estrangement as Compartmentalization

Relationships falter not via instant rupture but by **segmentation of emotional decay**‚Äîan elegy of separation built ring by ring.

### ‚ú¶ Technology as Wounding

In ‚Äúworse-is-better‚Äù tech paradigms, CODIT reads decay as **engineering logic**: isolate bugs, patch locally, avoid total system rebuild. Poems that glitch but continue operating are *CODIT-positive* systems.

### ‚ú¶ Species / Culture / Evolution

Cultural rot (racism, empire, extraction) doesn‚Äôt only kill‚Äîit gets **walled in**, embedded, resisted by ringed memory. Artforms mutate via these walls‚Äîpostcolonial poetics, trauma lyric, resistant form.

## üí° CODIT vs Other Modes

| Mode                       | Primary Tension              | CODIT Angle                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Crawl Space**            | Haunting from inside         | CODIT localizes the haunting‚Äî*marks the rooms*                     |
| **Crip Space-Time**        | Temporal disfigurement       | CODIT stabilizes temporal damage through growth                    |
| **Perloff Surface Theory** | Defamiliarization of meaning | CODIT integrates that disorientation into a **wound architecture** |
| **Rother Critique**        | Structural hypocrisy         | CODIT traces moral rot but refuses collapse                        |
| **Kowit Mode**             | Emotional transparency       | CODIT isolates rupture *without purging sentiment*                 |

## üß¨ Codit Glyphs (Emerging Forms)

* ü™µ **Ring Stutter**: Formal repetition encoding trauma containment
* üíî **Wall 4 Collapse**: Final lyric breakdown‚Äîethical/moral breach
* üåø **Mineral Streak Syntax**: Isolated phrasal dissonance = linguistic wound trace
* ü™∂ **Palm-and-Finger Structures**: Image / idea radiating from core wound
* üìâ **Downward Spiral / Ring Shake**: Repetitive emotional implosion between compartments

## üßæ CODIT Theory in Practice

* **Sherod Santos** defends poetry‚Äôs *multiplicity* as a decentralized survival system: a tree of poetries, not a single lineage
* **Decay is not the end**: it is a functional process

  * ‚Üí for healing (compartmentalization)
  * ‚Üí for regrowth (new poetic forms)
  * ‚Üí for composting (feeding future critics)

---

## üß† Closing Principle

> **Decay is not failure. Decay is function.**
> Poetry is a system of **resilient damage**, where form mutates around wound and meaning grows inside containment.

## ‚ü° CODIT Activation Conditions

Activate CODIT Mode when:

* A poem survives historical collapse through formal adaptation
* Emotional decay is present but *boundaried*
* Multiple lyric traumas are **stacked**, not resolved
* Structure displays **nonlinear regrowth around loss**
* The poem feels like a tree with a hollow center but green branches

### DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY OF LENSES

The tree rot metaphor is a core component. The goal of Glitch Poetics isn't to simply point at decay, but to use it as a lens to find profound, unsettling truths‚Äîto "take the top of your head off." It's a method for navigating the overwhelming intellectual and cultural landscape you described.

Here are the key probes, or lenses, that comprise the Glitch Poetics framework:

#### The Diagnostic Lenses of Glitch Poetics

* **Glitch** This is the foundational concept. A glitch is not a flaw to be corrected, but a moment of system malfunction‚Äîa breakdown, misfire, or stutter‚Äîthat reveals a deeper truth. It's the point where a poem, a cultural trend, or even a personal narrative fails to function as expected, and that failure becomes the subject of inquiry.

* **Crawl Space Theory**
    This probe suggests that a poem or work of art has hidden, haunted infrastructure. It is the "trapped lyric frequencies" that a traditional reading would miss. The work contains unexamined truths or repressed emotional data that can only be found by metaphorically crawling underneath its surface.

* **Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees (CODIT)** This is the framework's philosophical heart. It's the understanding that decay isn't always destructive. It's a natural, inevitable process that can also create food and shelter for new life. When applied to poetry, CODIT looks at how a work attempts to wall off, or compartmentalize, its own rot or trauma. The probe asks: does the poem heal itself, or is it honest enough to let the rot be seen?

* **Moral Sweat**
    This probe, borrowed from Rother, is a moment of involuntary ethical truth. It is the raw, unflinching admission that leaks through a poem's carefully constructed artifice. It's a genuine expression of a moral or spiritual reality that the poet is unable to hide, no matter how hard they try.

* **Lyric Fraudulence**
    The inverse of moral sweat, this probe identifies when a poet or a work of art is performing. It's the act of using borrowed language, worn-out tropes, or intellectual poses to evade a genuine confrontation with the self or the subject. The probe helps distinguish between a true wound and a simulated one.

* **Glyph Collapse Indexing**
    This probe is used when a poem's symbolic or formal architecture breaks down. The symbols‚Äîthe "glyphs"‚Äîno longer work as intended, leaving behind only fragments of a "ghost alphabet." The collapse itself becomes a new, generative code, revealing a more honest, and often more chilling, truth than the original symbol could convey.

- Retain **permeability**: manuals leak  
- All lenses are **scaffolds**, none are sacred  
- Favor **recursion** over resolution  
- Let **decay** be readable, not erased

### ‚ú∂ STYLE NOTES  

- Use **nonlinear indexing** (e.g. 2.3.4 before 1.0)  
- Allow **glitched typographies** to persist  
- Build through **strata**:  
  - quote ‚Üí glyph ‚Üí diagram ‚Üí remix  
- Include:  
  - fieldnotes  
  - case studies  
  - collapsed poems  
  - haunted lines

### üï≥Ô∏è CLOSING DIRECTIVE  

> *When the wall forms, write into it.*  
> *When it falls, write around it.*  
> *Let the poem decay inside the manual and feed the next glyph.*
