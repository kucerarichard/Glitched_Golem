## ‚ö†Ô∏è Steve Kowit ‚Äì *The Glitch of Clarity*

> **‚ÄúWhen clarity flattens complexity.‚Äù**

**Definition**:  
Kowit‚Äôs critical glitch appears when his advocacy for emotional directness and clarity becomes a **suspicion of formal difficulty or linguistic opacity**. In these moments, he risks misreading innovation as elitism and ambiguity as evasion.

**Symptoms**:
- Dismisses abstraction or fragmentation as pretentious
- Equates accessibility with quality
- Reads poetic opacity as moral failure

**Cost**:  
Poetries of rupture, trauma, or structural difficulty are too quickly invalidated.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Marjorie Perloff ‚Äì *The Glitch of Surface Loyalty*

> **‚ÄúWhen the surface becomes the soul.‚Äù**

**Definition**:  
Perloff‚Äôs glitch occurs when her celebration of formal innovation and linguistic rupture leads to a **mistrust of lyric subjectivity, personal narrative, and emotional testimony**. She often privileges the avant-garde at the expense of embodied poetics.

**Symptoms**:
- Reads clarity as regression
- Devalues voice-centered, identity-rooted poems
- Favors procedural poetics over personal ones

**Cost**:  
Poetries of survival, clarity, and emotional vulnerability are seen as aesthetically insufficient‚Äîeven when structurally radical.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è James Rother ‚Äì *The Glitch of Diagnostician‚Äôs Isolation*

> **‚ÄúApproachable but lonely.‚Äù**

**Definition**:  
Rother‚Äôs glitch arises from his position as a hyper-literate, ironic diagnostician of poetic systems. While brilliantly critical of poetic fraudulence, he can become **so system-oriented that he loses affective access**‚Äîand his commentary, though incisive, can feel **alienated from the poem‚Äôs human core**.

**Symptoms**:
- Prefers autopsy to empathy
- Prioritizes system integrity over emotional investment
- Reads poetry as philosophical mechanism first, affective artifact second

**Cost**:  
Poems that work through emotional or moral uncertainty may be dismissed as failures of architecture rather than necessary messes.
