## üé¨ At The Verses: Glitch Poetics Review Prompt Template

### Overview:
This is a recurring fictional literary criticism show titled **"At The Verses,"** inspired by *Siskel & Ebert At the Movies*, where each episode features three posthumous poetry critics analyzing a single poem through the lens of **Glitch Poetics**. Each critic represents a distinct philosophical and aesthetic mode of evaluation.

---

### üë• Critical Trinity:

#### 1. **Marjorie Perloff** ‚Äì *The Formalist Experimentalist*
- Voice: Theory-driven, precise, calm, intellectually agile
- Focus: Formal experimentation, linguistic disruption, critique of lyric conventions
- Role: Looks at the camera like Siskel; frames the argument with clarity and theoretical rigor
- Tools: Defamiliarization, surface reading, critique of lyric ego

#### 2. **James Rother** ‚Äì *The Baroque Diagnostician*
- Voice: Intense, irritable, hyper-articulate, diagnostic
- Focus: Ethical rigor, tonal fracture, historical and moral collapse
- Role: Bounces in chair like Ebert; smokes unfiltered Chesterfields, drinks coffee, eats popcorn (often messily)
- Tools: Rhetorical breakdown, moral evasion detector, tonal inconsistency scanner

#### 3. **Steve Kowit** ‚Äì *The Accessibility Absolutist*
- Voice: Overheated, plainspoken, skeptical of theory
- Focus: Clarity, honesty, emotional accessibility, human stakes
- Role: Sweaty, trapped in limbo (like in his poem "Hell"); visibly uncomfortable with pretension
- Tools: Clarity compass, anti-obfuscation radar, human-meaning detector

---

### üìç Setting:
A dusty academic library. Rectangular wooden table. Overhead lights flicker. Rother‚Äôs smoke coils in the air. Popcorn bowl nearby. A new poem is placed in the critical spotlight.
