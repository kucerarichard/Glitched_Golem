### Resuscitations: Rodman's Eclectic Anthology
as reviewed by James Rother

One Hundred Modern Poems, edited by Selden Rodman. Pellegrini & Cudahy, 1949.

   I can't remember exactly what hooked me into becoming a reader of poetry; nor can I recall just when or where it happened. I know that I was not much of a reader of anything until I graduated high school in 1956, a few months shy of being 16. Oh, I had collected comic books compulsively up to about the age of 13, but then tired of them and sold all 1200, packed into slovenly cartons, to a used magazine dealer for 2 cents each. After that, I took a vacation from virtually all printed matter (except school books) for about three years. It wasn't until the sabbatical year taken between high school and college that I tore--mostly out of boredom--into a pile of books left behind from my older sister's sojourn as a college literature major and developed a fascination with things poetical and fictional that has lasted me the better part of a lifetime.
     Thinking back to that time, I remember very few of those books having either "collected poems" or "selected poems" on their spines. They were almost exclusively novels and mostly British (my sister was already an Anglophile), with a smattering of French drama thrown in: Orwell's 1984, Lawrence's The Plumed Serpent, Anouilh's Five Plays--books like that. What anthologies of poetry came my way were put into my hands by friends who got them as book club bonuses and had no use for them. One such was The Criterion Book of Modern American Verse, edited by W. H. Auden, that came out the year I left high school. Somewhat conservative in its taste (the mid-'50s were a conservative time), the compilation contains all the names you might expect to find, but also some that might today seem rather eccentric choices; and a few, perhaps predictable, inclusions (e.g., three poems by Chester Kallman) that have dated along with others which have since disappeared from the radar screen altogether--Howard Griffin, James Broughton, and Robert Horan, for example.
     In his Introduction Auden stressed the Americanness of his selections, luxuriating (though "exulting" might be more accurate) in his own certitude that "From Bryant on there is scarcely one American poet whose work, if unsigned, could be mistaken for that of an Englishman." Though I was grateful for the opportunity to be able to read poets who were new to me, I was bummed that my then favorite poet, T. S. Eliot (whose Waste Land was my entrée to psychedelia) had been left out because of copyright restrictions imposed by his publisher, Harcourt, Brace & Company. And I really didn't find that much amid the cultivated wilds of Conrad Aiken, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Robinson Jeffers, say, to set my youthful imagination ablaze. Maybe it was my age--I was still only about 17--but much of it, at least to me, never quite transcended the condition of being stuff. I demanded of any poetry I was asked to admire that it do what Emily Dickinson insisted poetry had to do in order to be called great: it had to make you feel the top of your head had been taken off. The "Americanness" of these poets was largely irrelevant to me (my mother was American, but I was born and raised in eastern Canada); I knew no one close to my own age whom I could discuss modern poetry and all its complexities with; and besides, my interest lay more with those writers who combined the resources of vivid poetry with the radical discontinuities of stream-of-consciousness fiction. I had already happened upon Joyce, as well as some of his more inventive followers (the Faulkner of The Sound and the Fury, the Dos Passos of U.S.A., and the Pietrio di Donato of Christ in Concrete, to name but three), and by the time I was 18 I was already deep in the writing of a (since destroyed) free-verse novel, the chief subject of which was a very close friend of mine and his family. Among the poets (other than Eliot) whose work I was familiar with, like Dylan Thomas (his Collected Poems was another book club hand-me-down), I was most taken by those who had unequivocally kissed off "strong measures," who had managed to enter that realm where poetry was the pearl that could only be gotten at by prising open the prose shell that hid it from the light. I'd had enough of scanning feet and parsing rhymes, not to mention the poems by Tennyson and Bliss Carman that swam in them, in high school never to want to have to deal with such things again. They had taught me, against their own grain, that they were everything real poetry was not, and it was a long time before I could look at a modern poem decked out in rhyming stanzas without gagging. Auden thought "Air" by Edwin Denby worth the labor of a careful read; I did not and still don't:

     Thin air I breathe and birds use for flying
     Over and through trees standing breathing in air
     Air insects drop through in insect dying
     And deer that use it to listen in, share-

     Thickens with mist on the lake, or rain
     Cuts it with tasteless water and a grey
     Day colours it and it is thin and plain
     Air in my mouth and air for miles away. . . .

     My freshman English course at university pawed the ground of various kinds of poetry, and it proved a bracing experience to read Chaucer, Spenser, Milton and Coleridge, along with, of course, Shakespeare, without having my appreciation of their verse stalled at the level of iambs, feminine rhymes and shards of Malory protruding from Idylls of the King. Most bracing of all, however, was the segment of the course devoted to 20th Century poetry. We read Hopkins, Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Auden and Thomas at a depth I and my fellow freshmen found utterly mindboggling. (My mind was perhaps somewhat less boggled than theirs because I had already read works like The Waste Land and had memorized several editors' explanatory notes to it and other poems.) I remember it was very "in" then to read every work of literature, in virtually every genre, as an allegory of the creative process and the superiority of the poet-protagonist to the sea of clods swarming over him with the single intention of shackling him with the irons of bourgeois morality. Bazarov's struggle in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons enacted this Nietzschean agon more vividly than many other relatively modern literary works, though Jean-Christophe, Romain Rolland's door-stopping novel loosely based on the life of Beethoven, ran it a close second. 
     This all took place in the late '50s, when jazz, and jazz-and-poetry fostered by the Beats (themselves extravagantly hyped by Grove Press and the Luce publications, Time and Life) ruled the roost of a powerful subculture increasingly dominated, in both America and Canada, by college-age youth. Poetry in and of itself was not all that popular within that demographic. What little of it that was read outside of college courses tended to be of the Beat-inspired sort favored by epigones of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and their circle, which meant that it had to look like William Carlos Williams, sound like e. e. cummings, and be about free love with Botticellian co-eds phantasmagorically on the make. The Beat movement raised a dust cloud of allusions to European, Asian and even Latin-American writers, but acquaintance with them never got much beyond the name-dropping stage with its younger clones and fellow travelers.
     Not being a joiner, I remained on the fringes of this activity as a student and, in a different life, as an off-campus lover of bop and progressive jazz. As cultural icons the Beats left me cold-possibly because I felt put upon by the slovenliness they cultivated, a down-at-heels unkemptness that called to mind the boxes I'd kept my comics in. The paperbacks that loomed largest during my undergraduate years were Kerouac's On the Road, Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, Hesse's Steppenwolf and Siddhartha--books that in beckoning to oases beyond the pale of mere literature prompted journeys of the soul to painted palaces irremovably implanted in the mind's eye. Where was the mast from whose lashings one could resist their call? Being under 20, part of me knew that the dispenser all that kickapoo joy-juice was a crock, but another part of me wanted to get drunk on it along with everybody else.
     The "mast" that fortuitously presented itself and which allowed me to restrict all contact with Hesse, Salinger & Co. to hearing friends talk enthusiastically about them, was the anthology that this recollection seeks to honor, Selden Rodman's One Hundred Modern Poems. Though I'm not absolutely certain, I think I acquired it in either 1958 or 1959, at the then newly-opened Little Classics Books in Montreal, which got its name by stocking nothing but quality paperbacks and first rate titles in pocket book format. A slim volume of 192 pages (its length was determined by its inclusion as a "single" volume of the Signet and Mentor Book series, put out by New American Library), the Rodman miscellany had appeared first as a Pellegrini & Cudahy hardback in 1949 and had been reprinted no fewer than five times by the end of 1956. Clearly, this was an anthology that had not only benefited from word-of-mouth referrals, but was also competing splendidly with the two powerhouse paperback anthologies then racking up the most copies sold, edited by Oscar Williams and Louis Untermeyer.
     What made the Rodman stand out favorably from its rivals? In a word, its eclecticism--which expanded to encompass a considerable variety of contents, lack of editorial bias, and a Sidneyan belief in the extendability of poetic qualities across generic lines. The first thing you noticed in riffling through its pages was the number of selections that were not, strictly speaking, in any kind of verse. "In this age of the break-up of old forms and the creation of new ones," Rodman declared in his lengthy Introduction, "it is not surprising that 'prose' has become a major vehicle for poetry, and that the most radical experiments in breaking down language itself to create a medium for the newly discovered 'subconscious mind' should be conducted by the poets James Joyce and Gertrude Stein--in 'prose'...." Brief excerpts from the former writer's "Anna Livia Plurabelle" (from Finnegans Wake) and the latter's Four Saints in Three Acts document the exceptionality of these two writers, but he goes on to pad out his demonstration with snippets taken, respectively, from novels such as Kafka's The Trial, Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, and Mailer's The Naked and the Dead; from works of belles-lettres such as Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon, Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, and Fleming MacLeish's Exploration by Air; and from prose-poems by Rimbaud (from Illuminations), Auden (from For the Time Being), and William Carlos Williams (from In the American Grain). And as if that weren't unorthodox enough, Rodman encapsulates his sense of modern poetry's crazy-quilt diversity in a quadripartite table of contents divided up into sections labeled "Beyond Frontiers," Forerunners," "The Age of Satire," and "The 'Forties." 
     The most engagingly heterodox of these segments is the first, "Beyond Frontiers," whose selections consist for the most part of marvelous translations of poems by such major European figures as Valéry, Lorca, von Hofmannsthal, Rilke, Blok, Mayakovsky, Brecht, and others at that exalted level of comprehensive vision and technical competence. A number of the more successful translations from the French, Italian and German are by Rodman himself, and he is ably abetted by the likes of Rex Warner, Roy and Mary Campbell, J. M. Cohen, T. S. Eliot (a fragment of St-Jean Perse's Anabasis), and J. B. Trend. Oddly enough, Rodman's own translations are careful to observe the decorums of rhyme and that particular reason one would have thought inimical to works exuding an impatience with "strong measures," as does Apollinaire's "Zone":

     This morning I saw a lovely street whose name I forget
     Fresh      as full of sunlight as a cornet
     The bosses      the workers      the stenographers like a flight
     Of birds pass four times between Monday and Saturday night
     Thrice in the morning the sirens croon
     A peevish bell stammers about the hour of noon . . .

-or Êmile Roumère's "Three Haitian Creole Moods":

     If age has left me like a fruitless tree
     These compensations still remain for me:
     Beauties toward whom I used to sweat and stamp
     Must come to me-in my rheumatic cramp. . . .

     I feel confident in saying that never in my encounters with literature up to that point had I come up against an embarras de riches that gleamed with the naked affluence conveyed on every page of One Hundred Modern Poems. Not a single poem in the entire book was without one supremely memorable or quotable gem, and many pieces boasted considerably more than that. Most anthologies that I'd picked up were weighted down with a lot of dead wood or featured selections so often reprinted that their inclusion seemed almost insulting to the reader's intelligence. Rodman's was sleek, streamlined and hot to trot with examples of verse that differed sharply from what littered most comparable samplings of the contemporary poetry scene. One example tells this tale more convincingly than almost any other, and the fact that it comes from a rather unlikely source makes it even more compelling. Louis MacNeice's "Goodbye Now, Plato and Hegel," about the highblown, flyblown rigors of an Oxford education, probably graces no other verse anthology than this one, but what a pity that is. With wit as punctual as an awl and wiseacre-owlishness that's a hoot on innumerable levels, the poem makes hay out of the irrepressible tendency of Oxonians to mix High Tables and high chairs:

     And then they taught us philosophy, logic and metaphysics,
        The Negative Judgment and the Ding an Sich,
     And every single thinker was powerful as Napoleon
        And crafty as Metternich.
     And it really was very attractive to be able to talk about tables
        And to ask if the table is,
     And to draw the cork out of an old conundrum
        And watch the paradoxes fizz. . . .

And where else but in Rodman could a young and inexperienced reader of new poetry find a poem as simple, as moving, as simply moving as this tribute to W. C. Williams by Kenneth Rexroth--and I make no apologies for the number of lines I'm about to quote:

     Now in a recent poem you say,
     "I who am about to die."
     Maybe this is just a tag
     From the classics, but it sends
     A shudder over me. Where
     Do you get that stuff, Williams?
     Look at here. The day will come
     When a young woman will walk
     By the lucid Williams River,
     Where it flows through an idyllic
     News from Nowhere sort of landscape,
     And she will say to her children,
     Isn't it beautiful? It
     Is named after a man who
     Walked here once when it was called
     The Passaic. And was filthy
     With poisonous excrements
     Of sick men and factories.
     He was a great man. He knew
     It was beautiful then, although
     Nobody else did, back there
     In the Dark Ages. And the
     Beautiful river he saw
     Still flows in his veins, as it
     Does in ours, and flows in our eyes,
     And flows in time, and makes us
     Part of it and part of him.
     That, children, is what is called
     A sacramental relationship.
     And that is what a poet
     Is, children, one who creates 
     Sacramental relationships
     That last always."--
     With love and admiration,
     Kenneth Rexroth.

Not all of Rodman's choices are as felicitous, however. His decision to sandwich Lawrence's Durrell's faux-Audenesque "A Ballad of the Good Lord Nelson" and A. D. Hope's poison-pen letter to his country, "Australia," between the Rexroth homage and Peter Viereck's marvelous "To A Sinister Potato" is, to this reader at least, both editorially inexplicable and a serious lapse in taste. Are we really to think that this sort of sixth-form salaciousness--

     The Good Lord Nelson had a swollen gland,
     Little of the scripture did he understand
     Till a woman led him to the promised land
     Aboard the Victory, Victory O--

is comparable to Viereck's cheek-on-tongue joust with the spud:

     O vast earth-apple, waiting to be fried,
     Of all life's starers the most many-eyed,
     What furtive purpose hatched you long ago
     In Indiana or in Idaho? 

And are we to accord a trifle like Rosalie Moore's "Imprecation for An Aesthetic Society with Newts, Warts, Waxes and Pins"--

     I'm ready now to cat-chase those porcelain people, get after them
     With bells like fire buckets, damn them
     With my own personal damn.
     Let them float into the garden like little images
     In saint formation.
     I will spank their loaves
     With a butterfly spanker. . . .

the same undivided attention that its back-to-back bookmate "The Progress of Faust, " by Karl Shapiro, warrants:

     He was born in Deutschland, as you would suspect,
     And graduated in magic from Cracow
     In Fifteen Five. His portraits show a brow
     Heightened by science. The eye is indirect.
     As of bent light upon a crooked soul,
     And that he bargained with the prince of Shame
     For pleasures intellectually foul
     Is known by every court that lists his name. . . .

     Anthologists, it seems tiresome to have to point out, are human, all too human: they have professional debts to pay, duties of friendship to observe, and prejudicial blindspots regarding the work of other writers to overcome. Rodman's contribution to the craft and sullen art of the anthologist reflects a batting average much higher than most of his competitors' around mid-century. Though very much of his time, he was also somewhat ahead of it, sensing in his preliminary statement to his readers the "luxury of narcissism" afflicting too much of its superior verse. He could with confidence credit "the passion for a loyalty, an identification with humanity transcending race, class, nation, profession, family [that] informs all the significant poetry of the war and the post-war period." If to him the alembication of these qualities seemed least adulterated in the work of two poets, Dylan Thomas and Peter Viereck--neither of whom is held in great esteem today--well, no one, not even a good anthologist, is any more perfect than he needs to be. Poets generally concentrate the brunt of their uniqueness, their ability to be the nerve center of their time's sensibility, on fixities of the eye or ear, but not both. Only the Dantes and the Shakespeares bring a fidelity to fact and the resources of language that transcends home theater to bring us sight and sound able to convert diction into a planetarium of singing spheres. But anthologists have to be able to sound the limits of the visible, no less than the subtlest frequencies of the audible, in their chosen art. And that is a conscription far fewer are up to than volunteer for. 
     To touch down again briefly on a runway already traversed: One Hundred Modern Poems proved influential in the life of one young reader--and writer--of poetry mainly because it altered the job description of the verse anthology in new and even radical ways. It treated prose-poetry and conventional poetry as co-equals in a war against artistic conformity (rampant around 1950), and viewed poetry not in English as prospectively on a par with poetry in the American language. Moreover, it refrained from insulting the taste, as well as the intelligence, of its readers by falling back upon tired and familiar translations of poetry by the big guns of European modernism--the Rilkes, Montales, Valérys, Lorcas, Mayakovskys and Nerudas. The livelier translations of these and other poets which Rodman either commissioned himself or scoured newer publishers' lists to find make the first section of Rodman's anthology, "Beyond Frontiers," a veritable joy to read and something to treasure for the long haul. Today, it's rare to find any book people hang on to for any length of time. Even coffee-table books and design-conscious productions costing real money find their way onto remainder tables in book store chains in record time. It is perhaps for this reason that Selden Rodman's slim slice of our recent cultural past should be brought back into print post haste by the New American Library. Its usefulness as a reminder of where literary modernism took us, unloaded us and left us to ponder its glories and derelictions is needed in these directionless times. Amid acts of senseless terrorism in our cities, and of terroristic senselessness in our cultural products, it might serve as a tonic to more than one contemporary thirst.   

		

### Out of the Notebooks
	As Reviewed By: James Rother



          Introduction: Now and then, the reviewer who turns out on average several hundred pages of prose a year flatters himself that the propulsive and opinionated letting off of steam in which he routinely engages ends by producing a portable torrent of prose that is not only gracefully informative but illuminating as well, and on rare occasions, even transformative. Much of that self-flattery involves a superadded filip of fantasy: that those who look forward to reading each new piece of his or hers as it appears might also hunger for evidence that the reviewer they like to read occasionally exceeds the bounds of his expertise and conceptualizes divertingly about things at some distance from his home turf. Surely, such readers must say to themselves, this guy must at some time find his attention wafting towards subjects other than poetry, things like music, film, painting and sculpture; towards issues generated by politics and their broader relation to matters of philosophy and culture; towards, in fact, matters pertaining to literature beyond poetry and poetics of the sort he usually lucubrates about. And so, they might relish now and then an opportunity to catch their critic just being himself to himself, as it were; to see him presenting himself in a style less formal or strait-laced than the one they’re used to—though they might dote on the everyday calisthenics of that—in dollops less elephantine than the signature pieces served up to them over the years. Habitués of Contemporary Poetry Review’s electronic pages, our reviewer might then conclude, just might take to having his non-professional professions periodically aired in the magazine, to listening in on his late-night meditations, jottings, impressions, aphoristic expatiations, bon mots, even his jokes and private jeux d’esprit packaged as one-liners, epigrams, and other instancings of the now far too uncommon “Martial arts.” Thoughts “out of notebooks,” if not out of season, inscribed in the margin, rather than where the foolscap normally meets the pen; not in the immortalizing vein of a Chamfort or a Nietzsche, but rather as F. Scott Fitzgerald performed in his posthumously published saturnalium in fragmentary form, The Crack-up, though under perhaps less trying circumstances than afflicted that particular collector of random aperçus.

          What follows, then, under the rather less than pious rubric of W. S. Di Piero’s “Out of Notebooks,” obeys no order beyond one loosely chronological spanning some fifteen years of constant note-taking, impressionistic scribbling, and late-night nitpicking under no other pressure than that exerted by the recording angel’s stylus. Whatever else can be said of the jottings below, they are me, if not in flagrante mis à nu, then certainly more unbuttoned than the last three or four years have seen me “above the fold” in Contemporary Poetry Review.

          Brecht against war, in Mother Courage, for instance: against capitalism, war is an ugly absurdity; young men die pointlessly. Against capitalism war is a heroic necessity; young men die, their blood watering the young shoots of socialism and equality. Brecht’s moral imperative rests on a mere comma (following “capitalism,” or not following “capitalism). “Some apples,” as Maggie, the stand-in for Marilyn Monroe in Arthur Miller’s play After the Fall, is heard to mutter.

          Film’s effectiveness grows in direct proportion to the degree to which the suasiveness of its images contradicts the ostensible meaning of its verbal superstructure, or that wordy, conceptual and thematic thing holding it together as a conscious construct. What is actually up there on the screen, graphically creating itself out of glyphs of light (remember the etymology of photography), represents the unconscious of film; the very tendentiousness of its plot or thematic order is its “conscious,” and in cinema what fuels its vitality as a medium  is an inversion of the old Freudian “saw” (a pontifical pediment of the psychoanalytic See), “All that was id will someday ego be.” All that is ego will, however, only maintain its integrity by being subverted, in a controlled way, by id (as comprised of images, not words). 

          The brouhaha over Michael de Palma’s recent film The Casualties of War, with Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox, drives home the truth of this paradigm with particular force. It is a commonplace of film criticism that de Palma’s movies war incessantly with themselves and with their scripts to a standoff that benefits the visual side of de Palma’s art over its argumentive dimension. The potency of this film’s imagery tends to overwhelm the forcefulness of what its screenplay appears to be highlighting as its central theme. One recalls The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael asserting that, for all its diverting and innovative camera work, the early ‘60s movie Hud, starring Paul Newman, Patricia Neal and Melvin Douglas, didn’t mean anything at all. Having strutted and fretted its hours on the screen, it leaves the shaping of its sense (beyond sensibility’s scattered leavings) to the filmgoer too taken visually with its attractive male star to notice, or care, that he or she has been seduced, even raped, by inconsequence. Hud is about Hud as a character but has little concrete to say about the character per se of Hud himself. He’s selfish, he’s a low-life, he manipulates people for his own ends; but Paul Newman’s imago up there on the big screen makes a mockery of those judgments with an insouciance born of the same T-shirted machismo that served Marlon Brando so well in A Streetcar Named Desire. Image wins out over palaver, over moral coming up short, over losing out in the end. Intentionally or not, the visuality of Hud “argues” that no one in his right mind would rather be a nondescript geek with a following at church than a conniving sonofabitch with Paul Newman’s looks and bankability. And so does The Casualties of War, if in a more violently acrimonious way.

          Idea for an article: “The Agenbyte of Unwit.”  Re: the new Joycean freedom at work in workaday language within the public media resulting in the fortuitous mot juste.  (Example: the liner notes for an Angel CD of highlights from Verdi’s Otello the French synopsis of arias (#9) contains the misprint granduellement for graduellement. The former is in a way far more “accurate” than the latter which, in signifying no more than “gradually,” is made to seem, in comparison to the printer’s error, “merely right.”) Not since the days of William Caxton has there been such anarchy in English lexicography, such willed ambiguity, as well as involuntary obscurantism, catechresis and mystification, in everyday language. This is in part due to the shotgun marriage of runaway technologization of “home and work stations” and advertissement verité, a spinoff of cinéma verité strictly for advertising purposes, in which the language and gestures of models in TV ads or movies become confused in memory with those having occurred in real-life situations. (Poster child for this sort of thing would of course be the now ex-president Ronald Reagan, who “remembered” movie scenarios as though they were true stories and true stories as though they were embedded in some film having flooded into memory with the tweaking of a sentiment.)

          One last example: a recent student essay yielded the quite marvelous fortuity/malapropism, “transumptuousness,” an artificial word you would think to find reposing somewhere in Finnegans Wake but in fact draws on the name of a trope not used intentionally since Milton’s time (transumptio), and which [Chaim] Perelman’s New Rhetoric describes as facilitating “the transposition of values into facts. ‘He forgets’ for ‘he is ungrateful.’”)

          [Jazz singer] Sarah Vaughan died today (April 4th). Dizzy Gillespie in an interview on National Public Radio recalled hearing her sing in Chicago. He was on a catwalk or in the wings of the auditorium, I forget which (he forgot which) and he was unable on one occasion that he remembered during her performance to tell just when one of her notes began. It was just there in the air being sustained, but it seemed not to have originated anywhere or at any particular moment. Proving once again that the art of singing is the near-perfect folding of legato into rubato. Frank Sinatra at times managed this, but only fitfully. Ella Fitzgerald, the most perfect jazz singer of all time vocally, achieved it whenever she opened her mouth to sing. ([2004]: Almost as few poets as musicians have imprinted on the page a sublimination of line and distribution of stress as an indistinguishable unity making the unscannability of their verse a virtue not a flaw.)

          Idea for a screenplay:

A.      General George S. Patton dies in a suspicious jeep accident in December 1945. Relations among the victorious allies, especially between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., are extremely tense. Stalin is fearful that the bellicose policy recommendations in favor of a quick, pre-emptive land-based and nuclear strike against the Soviet Union being voiced in certain quarters are being taken seriously in the highest reaches of the American government (especially its economic sector overseen by “the Jew Morgenthau,” then Secretary of the Treasury). This hair-trigger climate of misunderstanding is in part due to the information vacuum at the KGB with regard to the newly installed president, Harry S. Truman and his Missouri kitchen cabinet.

B.      Suspense is generated by the in-close and telescoped time frame of the action which extends from the first reports of Patton’s death and subsequent autopsy to the decision by Stalin and his inner circle (Beria, Molotov, Khruschev, etc.) to accept the status quo ante, meaning that Patton’s death was either a genuine accident or the result of an internal (i.e. in-house) assassination of a loud-mouthed and embarrassing general of no pressing concern to the Communist bloc. Towering difficulties present themselves here, since America had already, during the previous August, fired nuclear warning shots in Stalin’s direction (making it clear to the Japanese also that aggressive imperialism would no longer be tolerated by the United States). How would Stalin react to what looked for all the world like a pretext for pre-emptive war? 

C.      Plot then thickens as the consequence of double-blind checks misfiring, of miscontruals and misreadings of the situation on the Soviet side taking on the proportions of a “tragedy of errors. Much garbled “evidence” of a plot hatched in Washington is hastily assembled and interpreted. OSS (early CIA) interests butt heads with those of Army Intelligence, S.H.A.P.E. confidential services as well as against the KGB’s pusillanimous attempts to slant its best guess as to the real significance of Patton’s death to meet Stalin’s unknown expectations. All know how paranoiac he can be and act, or fail to act, accordingly.

D.      A series of progressive complications then set in:

1.      For a brief time the American authorities (unclear just whom these consist of) believe the Patton accident to have been staged. The question, left agonizingly open, is: by whom, and why? Was it a hit ordered by Truman’s top advisors? By Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower’s elite corps of assassins? By Communist insiders within the State or the War Department? By free-lancers unknown and unauthorized by any institutional arm? Or was the accident in fact nothing but an accident, as most who bought newspapers believed?

2.      Soon it occurs to a small group of left-leaning friends of the U.S.S.R. that even if Patton did die under perfectly toward circumstances, evidence—subtle evidence, so as not to alarm the American electorate—could be uncovered that would suggest that the policy of hitting Stalin with a presumptive strike was being deep-sixed for good. The idea was that by silencing the most vocal and obstreperous exponent of this policy, Patton, Stalin could thereby conclude that he was in no immediate danger of being again surprised, à la Operation Barbarossa, by forces hostile to the Soviet bloc.

3.      A further, even more troubling complication arises when the “responsible” agencies of the U.S. government discover the intent of the evidence planters and attempt to subvert their plans, not because they are averse to sending Stalin a positive and reassuring signal about America’s benign military intentions (it was a well known fact that more than a few high-ranking soldiers and congressional figures shared Patton’s hatred and contempt for all things Soviet), but because they fear a scenario of the worst case: a scandal erupting out of an exposé showing that an American hero was brutally murdered. (When word of the proposal to plant evidence of foul play at the scene of the accident reaches President Truman’s ears, he becomes virtually apoplectic.)

4.      A climax is reached when Stalin’s governing circle learns of the evidence planting operation which has been given a go-ahead beyond any fail-safe option of aborting the mission. How will Stalin read the chaotic activity back and forth (proceeding with the operation and then racing at breakneck speed to stop it without the world press getting wind of it) and what he will do about it.

5.      World War III is averted by the launching of a secret American counter-mission (authorized by Henry Wallace) to contact elements within the Soviet KGB and NKVD to try to convince the Soviets that while Patton might indeed have been the victim of unknown assailants, Washington wanted no further action on the eastern front in Europe. The mission is under the direction of a young OSS special agent played by a courageous Harrison Ford type who undertakes one last covert operation before he calls it a war and returns to his sweetheart in Indiana. . . .

         Ella Fitzgerald’s unique talent lay in her always swinging more than her rhythm sections, whether performing with a small group or with an orchestra. Rhythm sections are there ostensibly to drive the soloist. With Ella Fitzgerald the reverse invariably occurred. She could whip the sleepiest bassists and percussionists into shape and the result was the aural equivalent of a trompe l’oeil—a creative distortion of sonic perspective emanating from the region of perception where it counted most: that of rhythmic propulsion. It’s been said that with Fitzgerald on stage the music benefited from having two rhythm sections rather than just one. But in fact the truth is more complex than that: with her voice sailing above a regatta of accompanists, regardless of size, the music’s vocal line led the musical line to safe harbor in a way never before heard in the history of jazz.

          Listening to a lot of recorded music brings me back time and again to just what was gained or lost when the great tectonic shift occurred from an analog hegemony to a digital one ....

          Digital sound is a wash—of pastel watercolor, a flat panel of goofy Dufy done in almost garish detail emerging absurdly out from the gesso-like undercoat over which it was laid. Analog sound has depth of field but no “visionary” component. Its technic is to make you hear more scrupulously what is infra, whereas the scam of digital is to make you imagine “displayed” between speakers, or captured in “surround sound” (as in Quadraphonic), a field of sound fully energized by a wealth of detail impressively laserized into “view.” Both analog and digital chase after incandescence: the former promises it, the latter reneges on a commitment to provide it.

          Digital sound: a two-dimensional abstract, in superb “sonics,” of music dropped down a deep hole. The consequences of this—almost all negative—are nothing less than mind-boggling. Generation after generation imagining high fidelity becoming higher and higher with each new infusion of gadgetry, without anyone realizing that the “fidelity” that has taken off over the years is faithfully reproducing little more than its own two-dimensional flat-line, its own ear-outering pastiche of engineered sounds. What we’ve been treated to then—and this holds up irrespective of money spent on “components”—is a Potemkin village of sound reproduction, the illusion of an illusion of fidelity in expensive aspic.

          Another measure of loss in these anodynamic times, the disappearance of good stand-up comics. Stand-up today is fuelled by two compromises with acerbity that afflict our culture mavens: “slice of life” (not what the French immortalized as une tranche de vie, but the original basis of all comedy served up in a short, telling burst of incongruity), and what can be whittled down to “a piece of one’s mind” given gratis, which is to say, without expectation of either a consulting fee or smiling approval. The latter is usually a peeve petted in simulation (rhetorically sculpted for the occasion) of rage and made to seem spontaneous, even improvised on the spot. (For some reason, an enormous number of purveyors of this “art” were, at all levels in the heyday of the TV variety show, named “Jackie.”)  The typical stand-up comic these days wanders glibly from mindless crux to mindless crux in a simulation of critique. There is endless shuffling from Horkheimer’s back forty to Adorno’s front office and back again, but with barely a trace of dialectic and even less enlightenment.

          Realism can best be defined as that which we ought to have no time for less of. It goes against the grain of our common humanity to argue otherwise, to give mind flips like surrealism more than the merest glint of alertness and attention. It’s the poet who should most insist on this, too. The novelist can claim he’s a realist because he gives all the shared mayas their due in a language cultivated to preserve them whole and intact under this Balzacian or Tolstoyan rubric. But such flim flams are just that: shell games for the rubes who settle for knowing where the pea isn’t. Where the pea is is something only the poet can show us, while all the novelists are telling us how best to attend to their “road maps for the soul,” to quote Bob Dylan.

          In his later writings especially, the late critic Paul de Man not only muddies the waters, but then works hard at further watering down the mud he himself has needlessly churned up. What resulted from such obfuscation, such defacing of textual façades, was but a new, glitzily wrought version of the Swiss phenomenologist Georges Poulet’s radical “sedimentalism,” cleverly marketed as unreconstructed (read “Yale-divinized”) deconstruction. The brouhaha since his death in 1983 has finally died down to the point where he has dwindled to a sunspot on the azimuth of pain that is the literary part of the Humanities’ existential crisis as a relevant source of studies. How could his amen corner not have seen what was front and center in his literarizing from the beginning—a Luciferian rage to disorder the classics he could not creatively overmatch with destructive pieties charging the artistically great with poetic mismanagement. I guess that if you can’t write an A La Recherche du Temps Perdu yourself, the next best thing is to subject the actual one to death-by-a-thousand-cuts as enacted-out in this Schlockmeister’s much anthologized essay “Semiology and Rhetoric,” where an almost successful attempt is made on the life of what might well be the greatest of all literary masterpieces by painting a picture of Proust up as a shallow bumbler given to fobbing readers off with shopworn clichés (like the phrase de Man himself labored to make infamous, torrent d’activité) and playing on their incredulity in other equally devious ways. So corrupt with ideological malfeasance is the academic profession of “literary studies” that even de Man’s one-time student Stanley Corngold’s startling revelations about his mentor’s having used cooked translations of his own for illustrative purposes when the prospect of making a weak point in an analysis loomed larger than was normal scarcely caused a ripple in his posthumous international standing. It was only when another devoted ex-student accidentally uncovered the goods on this runner of contraband that the sky actually fell, leaving the Chicken Littles of deconstruction at more than a Derridean loss for words.

          This has been said more times and in as many ways as “Merry Christmas,” but it needs to be said as many times and in as many ways as it takes to drive home the purport of the one cross Oscar Wilde was not hung out to dry on: the incontrovertibility of art and life as an interchangeable either/or.  A book, most especially a novel, is a rain check on life lived by other means, to adapt the famous remark by von Clausewitz about war. Reading one, no matter how privileged or exalted, is always inferior to life lived by its own means, out in the world in the company of other people. Curling up with a novel—the phrase itself is imbued with overtones of decay, of desiccation—confesses the repressed truth of nothing else to do, if not necessarily “nothing better to do.” Those who read compulsively do so less out of curiosity or devotion to artfulness (unless it be that called upon in dodging life’s oncoming cars and trucks) than out of inadequacy deferred to spectral surrogates haunting the printed page of fictional works. We should never forget that life is the roast beef and art the Dijon mustard. Which makes Groucho’s brother Chico the most prescient of Marxists, since we owe to him (and secondarily to S. J. Perelman, Will B. Johnstone and Arthur Shackman, the contrivers of the film Monkey Business) the observation that “Mustard is no good with roast beef.” Wilde, for all his wallowing in condiments and truffles, would no doubt have agreed.

          American Beauty, a movie in a genre of which The Graduate is chief prototype as well as archetype, continues the once-in-every-decade sequence of films that purport to show us the most recent morphings of the affably grotesque in American life, most notably in suburbia where denizens of the sort met with here tend to congregate. These are movies that further literarize the rheumatoid distortions of a Sherwood Anderson or a Nathanael West into gorgeous cameos of mutant despair and ennui that we now recognize as having all along been cinematic—meaning that we don’t so much identify with their hapless protagonists so much as we are flattered to absorb their assigned Hollywood profiles into our own self-imaging repertoire. In their cinematographic clutches the relentless progress toward that terminally desperate moment when America’s suburbanites, their Mercedes’s and BMW’s drawn into a gleaming circle of apocalyptic finality, face back-to-the-walldom and the unsettling prospect of discovering how little suited they to defending life and honor—indeed how little of each still inhabits in their pinched and starved existences as they stare out from battlements built with Home Depot know-how at the unkempt horde at their community gates, strutting with Joyce Carol Oates panache their backlot specials, low-riding Harleys, and clunkers of effaced provenance that no dealer, even one seized by a fit of neighborliness, could service as his own—the mob in excelsis, with hate in their eyes and the lust of the excluded in their hearts.

          American Beauty offers as much of that peculiar emptiness marking the pseudo-sublime (e.g., Ricky Fitz’s camera ballet of a baggie in the wind before an autumnal snowfall) as it is possible to concoct, given the limited purview of even the most giftedly energized cinematography. For it labors in a garden that is at best—and at worst, also—a literary garden of excessively recognizable verbal symbols such as the rose of Sam Mendes’s title. Except that, the apparent evasion of a mismatch between the flower and the titular “American Beauty” aside, we are endlessly reminded, frame upon sumptuous frame, that only the outsized American Beauty rose up there on the screen is fit for the uses of cinema, and then only because, the movie’s rationale, at a loss for the very words all that roseate imagery has reduced to a stammer, requires that a reality be projected which denotes prickliness devoid of thorns. Unfortunately, only a work of literature can provide a simulacrum of such toxicity. It takes words on a page, not attractive bodies on a screen, to do justice to the septicaemia on a grand scale that Mendes and his team had in mind to fondle if not lance. 

          But—and it is a huge but—no one much reads Sherwood Anderson, Edgar Lee Masters, or Edwin Arlington Robinson anymore, except in college survey courses where they tend to be exceptionalized as vampire exponents of grotesqueries that will not die, rather than as plumblines of the American Unconscious (which has also fallen into disrepute these days, given the discrediting of anything Freudian since Adolf Grünebaum’s devastating critique). Which is why I predict a short and happy life for the Francis Macomber moment that is American Beauty. It will win few academy awards, though it will no doubt be received in certain circles with awe and admiration. It will pass from sight, having shown us via its not so secret decoder ring, how fragile our continuing existence is in this one-toke-over-the-line shooting gallery we call a culture. Roses might open and shut with the coming and passing of the light, yet thorns remain poised to draw blood, which reminds us that incisors are found lurking even in the sweetest mouths. And so they should: their sting outlasts by a garland of days the petal bursts they endure as spear-carriers attending the ingénue. Which is why the Luther Burbanks of the rose created the American Beauty in the first place, and why those who gave their motion picture that name followed suit. Thorns—that is to say real thorns make for lousy box office, and that—to quote Lily Tomlin’s tyke—‘s the truthhhh.

### Between Poetry and Prose: A Critical Ballet in Three Scenes  
Scene One: The Prose of Poetry
	As Reviewed By: James Rother
                    I 

The failure of the not infrequently blabby Ezra Pound to sharpen a remark made in one of the many admonishing letters sent to Poetry’s then editor, Harriet Monroe—“Poetry must be as well written as prose”—has surely proved a fateful one. Not specifying that it was only good prose he was talking about turned no more than a mildly controversial aside into a flashpoint somewhere between an adventitious casus belli and a call for the desanctification of Veronica’s napkin. At any rate, since its first dissemination in print this mantra has become one of the dominant rallying cries of American vers-librists eager to defend W C. Williams’s free-basing of Imagist eye candy against the controlled and Symboliste-backed dérèglements of an emigré from even deeper recesses of the American literary hinterland, T. S. Eliot.

One can speculate endlessly as to why so hooded a misunderstanding could have triggered such a resounding frisson within the modernist unconscious-about-to-become-conscious, but the how gives far greater pause. Mounting Georgian impatience with the slow removal of Victorian shackles and hesitancies might’ve had something to do with it, but then, so might’ve the concussion administered to English pastoralism by the later novels and verse of Thomas Hardy, the inside-out dandyism of George Moore, and the musique concrète infused into Irish Volkslieder by the newly im-Pounded Yeats. Sent winging as a directive which literary London had far greater reason to heed than subliterary Chicago (Pound being less stoppered a conduit for control-freakery exercised between Imagism’s dusk and Vorticism’s barely-struck noon than the volatile founder of BLAST, Wyndham Lewis), the half-life of “Poetry must be as well written as prose” would eventually prove as surprising to its source as it had once seemed obvious (and overdue) to its disseminating mouth. Even now, a century after its utterance, it remains to third- and fourth-generation Ezroids an article of faith (and one hardly to be questioned) that not only are the interests of poetry best served by the manners of exactitude first declared basic etiquette in the lapidary works of Flaubert and de Maupassant but—and here the screed’s warp is crosscut by a rather more draconian woof—poets are to view as self-evident none but such truths as are thrown boldly into relief by observances of that kind. But to properly declare themselves aligned with these prerequisites, vers-librists also had to hew to the ABC’s laid down by the arch-modernist Hammurabi who had given them the force of law, as well as follow, in no less devoted—or variably footed—a manner, the lead of his cohort from U. of Penn. days, William Carlos Williams.

Countless “informalist” poems strung together between 1915 and 1935 stemmed from misreadings of these ABC’s, with the result that a run of doggerel was unleashed the expired poetic license of which sprees of transgressive lineality à la E. E. Cummings and uncharged roaming à la just about anybody at all seemed hardly the lowest case. Which is not to say that all, or even most of the verse written by the torch-bearers of Objectivism and displayed like lawn flamingoes filched from front yards cultivated by that same W. C. Williams and his colleague, George Oppen, was second-rate. Or that the much later poetry, written by another Williams—C. K.—hung unceremoniously out to dry on clotheslines awash with limply prosaic hand-me-downs, amounts to a case of not just less parading as more, but of more denying it is more of the same. No less perceptive a discerner of other poets’ dirty laundry than W. H. Auden was able to see past the proletarian scuff marks (and his own formalist astigmatism) to the kernel of genuine Americanism in poems of an aboriginally Objectivist stamp, and he did not have to bite his tongue in acknowledging as one of the most treasurable love poems in the English language the sunset elegy of Williams’s declining years, “Asphodel, that Greeny Flower,” the most amazing among several heart-stopping triumphs brought together in the collection Journey to Love (1955). Auden left it to later generations to squabble over whether Imagism had indeed wrought the havoc wreaked upon American verse in the modernist half-century which the dour and dyspeptic Yvor Winters had insisted upon in Anatomy of Nonsense. Furthermore, he even allowed, in the Introduction to his anthology The Criterion Book of Modern American Verse (1956), that poets maturing in the United States during the age of Eisenhower could do worse than defy the Moses and Joshua of modernism in no longer dismissing Walt Whitman as an indifferent drummer who managed to be unconscionably tuneless as well. For a poet-critic who revered the relatively strait-laced Thomas Hardy this side of idolatry, it was not the fungibility of free verse (on which the jury was still out) that was in question but the insistence, brassily vocalized after World War II by legions of variable-foot doctors (interning with podiatrist-in-chief W. C. Williams), that only poets adhering strictly to the guidelines laid down by Olson, Creeley, and countless fellow Black Mountaineers were fit to display the seal of approval, “American,” on their verse, irrespective of how many New Critics, backed by this or that praetorian guard of prissy poets and spoiled-rotten publishing house editors, might scream bloody murder at such a meld of slumming and noblesse oblige.

Actually, the “prose content” of modern poetry has inspired almost as much debate as the fat content of certain popular diet foods. At best, the metabolism of poetry can withstand only so much concentration of proteins in its intake, or conversely, their sudden depletion, without the risk of overshooting the Mallarmean azur entirely on the one hand, or collapsing rhythmlessly into sloppy seconds on the other. Throughout the history of verse, poets have been fascinated with testing how far the envelope of the Dylanesca’s “no direction home” could be pushed before the “dead letter” effect propelling language beyond the pale of re-enlivenment irreversibly set in. For years now, differences between verse lines noticeably distended syllabically and raw “prose poetry” (or, less respectably, poetic prose) have become progressively more difficult to spot. Meters once spotlighted by rhythms as distinguishable as drum tattoos have increasingly flipped into retreat mode before the onrushing tumbrel of fourteeners and other horrors of the sans-culotte prose lobby, offered either straight-up as a in shot glass or watered down into a litany-sans-ground parodying the “stiff burdoun” (or deep-chested descant) to the prick-song reported to have been sung by Chaucer’s Pardoner in The CanterburyTales.

Anyone who has researched the off-tempo march of poetic forms knows that vers libre is a cow that centuries other than the twentieth have viewed as eminently serviceable if not of the flat-out sacred variety. Most reliable literary handbooks offer accounts not unlike the following to remind students of its pertinacity:

Hebrew verse (like much Oriental poetry) is based on large rhythmical units and . . . our familiar Psalms and Song of Solomon are as definitely free verse as anything Carl Sandburg has written. Nor is the form new to European literature: France has practiced it for many years; Heinrich Heine used it in his The North Sea; W. E. Henley and Matthew Arnold practiced it in England; Walt Whitman shocked America with it before 1860. Stephen Crane employed it before Amy Lowell. . .

Text production of free verse has often threatened the more sensitive musical ear with indiscriminate swamping, as witness the eclipse of Paul Verlaine in the 1870’s at the hands of the cult that burgeoned around his drunken boat-mate, Arthur Rimbaud. And who, much more recently, has not marveled at the ascendancy of John Ashbery’s “willful poetics” over the “strong measures” advocacy of less fibrillative technicians like Howard Nemerov, Richard Wilbur, Mark Strand, and Gjertrud Schnackenberg? Finally, how to account for the fading-in-the-stretch (barring a brief period of reascendancy in the ‘80s which fizzled before the ‘90s were properly under way) of the entire post-war American neo-formalist movement from the early 1960’s on? Could readers at last have become fatigued with too much of a good thing registering as an auto-immune system become allergic to itself?     

The argument that the last half-century of American vers libre has helped keep the art form of poetry alive in ways no strong-measured stroking in tide-pools could have made possible remains one difficult to unseat. The formalist verse of those decades was not uncommonly beset by an arcaneness of subject matters that even the revivalist tent of its own shortsighted pitching could not long sustain. (One typically towering example of this tendentious sin: Edgar Bowers’s Collected Poems of 1999 in general and the relatively early “From William Tyndale to John Frith” in particular.) Absent the brief flutter or two of wobbly resuscitation, its hospital stay was a matter of one I.C.U. relapse after another, with little promise of a turn-around in vital-signs that any but the most credulous could foresee. The disappearance from the scene not long ago of Donald Justice, one of the last succulents still judged Hardy among the still-standing annuals and perennials of American formalism, no doubt puts the capstone on an elaborate tomb whose construction work may have endured numerous layoffs and work stoppages but has nonetheless advanced toward completion with relentless drive. Launched by a revival of neo-Audenian practice and kept tenuously afloat by aging oarsmen during the ‘70s and ‘80s less keen on exploration than on braving shallows and hugging shores, this Beowulfian flame-bucket has been listing badly ever since Donald M. Allen’s anthology, The New American Poetry proved the surprise undergraduate hit of 1960. Frederick Morgan’s Hudson Review and Hilton Kramer’s New Criterion can pretend until the cows come home that the trumpeting heard over those vales was taps and not reveille, but it was journals like Brad Morrow’s Conjunctions, with its unlikely blend of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E sound poets, third-generation Projectivists, and geriatric New York Schoolers to which credit was ultimately due for having whipped the post-Vietnam generation into a froth, and not any Tours to Jurassic Park undertaken in honor—or honour—of Andrew Marvell or Samuel Johnson. Whether one approved of it or not, the banner of vers libre flew high over Poetry’s city on the hill all from the ‘70s through the ’90s and beyond, even as trendy if less gold-plated ‘zines risked looking obsolete to confound the skeptical with a lot of faux experimentalism whose siren calls Parnassus would not for a moment countenance and the ancient trend-setter, recently luxuriant in its hundred-million-dollar digs, could never (until the tenure of Christian Wiman) quite face up to.

Whence derived the moxie to risk defying not only centuries of sang froid congealed into short lines, but also the dead march of Cultural Studies whose philistine phalanxes were willing to trample in the dust any art reluctant to prostrate itself before the People’s sovereign right to have its maw stuffed with as much politically correct pap as it could possibly hold?

Probably from the refusal of certain visionaries to write “30” to exercises in futility afflicted by the likelihood of turning off readers not having reached that age, while sending into tailspins of nostalgia numerous others having been around more years than a score and ten and with little more to look forward to than extended panting sessions on mortality’s ever-narrowing strand. Does anyone really doubt that before very long in this new millennium of ours American poetry, whether wholly vers libre-ed out or endlessly rebraided into retro-morphs of the Petrarchan sonnet, will seem to Generation Z as moribund as the dream of Michael Jackson’s to have himself refloated as Coke’s or Pepsi’s King of Pop? Perhaps Frank O’Hara’s City of Poets 2.0, or even 3.0 is finally upon us, having insinuated itself as the vampire matrix of choice in today’s heartland of the Resolutely Undead. In many ways this would be entirely fitting, since as a place of stopped time where zombies on decasyllabic drip continue to re-animate the image of cardiac arrest occurring in an infinite regress of monitors and life screens. Such a frenetic vision of limbo would at least preserve in formaldehyde what in livelier times had been relied upon to keep the blood flowing to each and every vesicle of the body impolitic—living speech.

But enough about the not quite dead. Less Anne Rice-ish but still lacking adequate wind-tunnel is the overdrawn but by no means exhausted downdraft of “nearly new” poetry which, with the help of such veteran Draculans as Ashbery and (C. K.) Williams, has successfully interposed itself between morbidities that have demonstrated themselves embraceable by both past and present and unfailingly reliable as cash cows. A proven pander to lapsed affairs, poetry’s answer to the talkies has flourished, one can only assume, as a result of the embarrassment many writers (and, needless to say, readers) have felt over the parlous state of contemporary verse, with its paint-ball skirmishes between Dead Poet Societies—late-Blooming Stevensians against gangs of motor-mouthed recyclists calling themselves “L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets.” The problem is not one of a decided tropism toward prose poetry, but with the not always reasonable facsimile of that Baudelairean anomaly which is proving positively ubiquitous in many print journals and on the internet. (This phase of the argument will be taken up in “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Prose Poem,” the present essay-triptych’s projected third panel, as well as in the conclusion to a second installment devoted to the enpurpling of prose that continues unabated in much current fictional, as well as non-fictional, writing.) 

          If it is true that in the course of slavishly retracing the figure-eights etched on bourgeois probity’s wafer-thin ice by épatineurs of la belle époque like Paul Verlaine and Tristan Corbière, 20th-Century modernists rendered more than just their own lines blurry by not credibly distinguishing a largely faltering poeticism from newly resurgent prose. The determination shown by these writers to extend the conversational range of verse beyond the pale to which the likes of Kipling and Hardy had often absent-mindedly consigned it should likewise not be cheated of the discredit it richly deserves. For these modernists, the Game seemed everywhere afoot and pursuable for stakes far greater than any imagined by insufficiently late Victorians who either were tardy in dumping their stock in Nineties aestheticism or with equal desperation grabbed up as much of it on margin as a plummeting market allowed. At issue was not what a poem could be empowered to say, but what, by fair means or foul, it could be enabled to move and shake. No doubt this explains why so much phantom dust was raised over poetic modernism’s vaunted letch for the vernacular and for as many unfiltered and near-to-obscene evils as could be made to flower, Aubrey Beardsley-like, on its pages. Hordes of critics uninterested in the modernist phenomenon on principle were of course quite exercised by this. They spared no effort in trilling the mordent that the sit-com laugh-tracking the over-stayed welcome of the 19th Century-avant-garde had slipped ignominiously into re-runs and the naiseries of the Continental Follies of 1848, despite deceptive repackaging, were merely déjà vu all over again. By their lights, having to endure the book-publishing Eliot of 1917 rehashing the otiose laments of the as yet barely known one of 1910 about having been slighted by mermaids whose only crime, so far as anyone could tell, lay in their refusal to serenade a wallflower inadequately disguised as a prophet whom even the ventriloquist responsible for his voice refused to be associated with, recalled rather too vividly, it was thought, indignities perpetrated on the burghers of France four decades earlier by an even more wretched clutch of pranksters led by those insufferable enfants terribles, Arthur Rimbaud and Jules Laforgue. Again, what cried out for something other than random voicing was a stand—principled if need be— against all such resurgences of nostalgie de la boue of the sort taken by M. Cuvillier-Fleury, the unflappable house critic of Journal des Débats, when a review copy of Flaubert’s Madame Bovary landed with an echoing thud on his desk in the fall of 1857. It’s enough to cite but one of the turbo-harrumphs directed by him at that book’s incorrigible human screw-ups: “Ce sont des mannequins ressemblants.” Flaubert’s own Bouvard and Pécuchet could hardly have put the matter more succinctly.

The “gutter Parnassians” (as poets prepped by Rimbaud were dubbed) made much of isotopic prose passing itself off as radiant poetic folderol. They feigned chagrin at any allusion to apocalypse because to mention it was not only showy but masochistically titillating past any level they could own up to without simultaneously acknowledging their kinship to the crassest of feuilletonistes. Because verbalizing on or about such debasements could engender real pain on when committed to print, they promoted to carnivale what earlier sideshow operators like Baudelaire had been content to market as loss-leader sadism or faux-Saturnalia for the perversion-deprived. It doesn’t take a Lacanian with the Imaginaire of a rocket scientist to see triumphalism gesticulating wildly in all such spasms of the maladroit. Rather, one wonders why the resident geniuses on either side of that cultural divide were so slow in calling a shot heard round the world. What Rimbaud and his cousins from their distant but still accessible remove from established poetic paradigms ended up sponsoring was not a revolution in poetic taste and manners but a mysterium more taken up with the investiture of a High Prosaics than with psychedelicizing a late-to-flower Romanticism adept at in turning on poets from Keats all the way to America’s own Hart Crane.   

Poets whose practices anticipated those of the Church of Latter Day Symbolistes (always excluding, of course, Mallarmé) were stayed from experiments with an ever-loosening poetic line because they feared—sensibly and with due cause for alarm—a precipitous descent into doggerel or a mongrel derivative every bit as mangy and unmanageable. In historicizing this, one is reminded of the casualties inflicted upon practitioners of the Tudor daredevil act known as the “fourteener” which, in the hayday of template tectonics presided over the two Georges, Gascoigne and Puttenham, dragged, even more haltingly than the Alexandrine, its slow length along. Who but their contemporary, Arthur Golding, master illusionist and tyer of Ovidian slipknots elidable into Shakespearean rope sculptures, could have imagined that such fleet footwear could be conjured from so pedestrian a kitbag of iambics? Lag, droop, waddle, and halt can, by dint of the appropriate magic, convert themselves into a ballet of perfections, but only when a master skilled in neutralizing torque that would otherwise herd outriding syllables into strings of front-loaded tongue-twisters is put in charge of them. For those who believe the flaccidities of the fourteener beyond anyone’s ability to keep its prosody safe from apoplexies of ritard, it’s hard to imagine, as does Pound in his perdurable ABC of Reading, an Ovid enthusiast giving this beast the ride of its life and revealing it a thoroughbred through and through. True, most Elizabethans who essayed its use never got past insertion of the bit, bestriding its unstraddlable girth as though they were seeing a mechanical bull eat up the last of its springs, but not Arthur Golding. Not only was he artful at counteracting the lag, droop, waddle, and halt the hendecasyllabic was notoriously heir to, but he left marble what nearly all translators of the Metamorphoses found, and were content to leave—quartz:

            Nor day, but middle bound of both             a man

                        may term of right.

            The house at sodaine seemed to shake,   and all

                        about it shine

            With burning lampes,         and glittering fires to

                        flash before their eyen.

            And likenesses      of ougly beastes with gastful

                        noyses yeld.

            Fore feare whereof       to smokie holes the sisters

                        were compeld

            To hide their heades,        one here and there

                        another for to shun

            The glistering light.   And while they thus in

                        corners blindly run,

            Upon their pretie limmes       a fine crispe

                        film there goes

            And slender finnes      instead of handes        their

                        shortened armes enclose.

            But how they lost their former shape        of

                        Certaintie to know

            The darknesse would not suffer them. . . .           

But, ah the woe that betided those for whom the castles reared on that peculiar prosiness over whose chasms Golding resyllablized Ovid’s course in advanced physics appeared construction projects best tackled from the top down. Why were English poets so long in accurately appraising that schematics of darkness (a full century was to elapse before the epic cup of ténèbres poured by Milton was given leave to run over—in blank verse) this prince of poets so splendidly made visible?

 

                                                             II 

Modern revivers of the elastic poetic line have not been unaware of the hazards incurrable when producing verse that falls between the cracks—as the current solecism would have it—of sporadic gassiness and full-on flatulence:

            She used the neighbor’s roof as a reference point, liking its precarious

                    congruity,

            a mobile performative at the nightline: what a woman thinks about

            before she conceives. See how they run, driven with carelessness,

            clouds cutting up over the rooftops like comedians, like blind mice

            dispensing with threes. As this was a theatrical positioning,

            I sat between them, trifocally, an intermediate vision

            held commonly at arm’s length: Take my hand, I can’t see.

            The boundaries of the third term blurred, there is in some part

            a percentage of the other part. May as a fifth month or an auxiliary,

            each a dispensable conditioning, given the farmer’s wife,

            who, at this point, may be reaching out a hand to cover the distance,

            as if to carve out a bridge or a tree. 

Thus does Catherine Imbriglio’s “Triskelion” set forth in a rattletrap that crepitates toward felicity and grace with all the directional sense of a three-legged gopher in a hailstorm. But Imbroglio’s embroglio hardly represents the lowest perch to which such “working the crank” can sink. “Triskelion” at least trundles its measure along past the “theme and variations” seriatim of, say, a Norma Cole (in, for example, “Conjunctions”), or a Leslie Scalapino in a romp as dismally choreographed as “The Tango.” A  C. K. Williams can, but not always does, make good on the promise held out to the ear by those suspension bridges of breath (kept obsessively in trim throughout much of Whitman) which have been known to shimmy like wild thyme in the wind in grosser hands:

                        An erratic, complicated shape, like a tool for some obsolete task:

the hipbone and half the gnawed shank of a small, unrecognizable ani

            -mal on the pavement in front of the entrance to the museum;

grimy, black with fire-dust, soot, the blackness from our shoes, our ink,

            the grit that sifts out of our air. . . .

                                                                        (“Bone,” from Repair [1999]) 

It’s a long way back from here to Golding’s supple fourteeners, or for that matter anyone else’s from that period worth a representative quotation. But even a Gascoigne could tell a hawk from a handsaw when groping for sounds unlikely to turn even reciters unfortified by Hamlet’s advice to the players into fumbling marshmallow-mouths. A throw of yarrow stalks wasn’t necessary to predict when lines weighty with excess cushioning and folds of bazaar-damask (Gascoigne’s seldom failed to make the cut) were likely to totter and go plop with something less than Longinian sublimity. Nor did he need jousts with contemporaries to tip him to when samples of his work came a cropper and popped before they could properly fizz.  Augustans like Pope knew which sort of laughter was likely to meet practitioners of “the art of sinking in verse” when they failed to distinguish lines that did in the satirist from those intended to fell the satirized. Content to be helots indentured to the oligarchy of genres Virgil and Horace established, they never had to confront—as the modernists did repeatedly—the space of dismantlement where genre, hardly more than a spent force, had callowly dissolved into shadowplay. The Romantics had preceded the modernists in transforming the fact of enfance disparue into a Disney-like world in which visionary gleams exist only to be later noted as having lost their auras. Unfortunately, this deprived the visionary poet of anything meaningful to do beyond concocting Byzantiums from the remains of what all-inflating innocence leaves behind when childhood gleams give way to “whither-is-fled”’s. If there is one shortcoming to Augustan poetry that cannot be easily explained away, it is that the rather brief season spent by it in the sun came up lamentably short in providing for its post-“shock and awe” period. No major poet before Auden thought to point out that the singular glory of the age of Pope and Johnson, the heroic couplet, had died intestate, nor why the reputations of so few of its leading lights were dragged out of mothballs before the New Critics like W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. and Maynard Mack awakened doubters of those poets’ artistic worth from their slumber. Even so devoted a disembalmer as T. S. Eliot found the lengthy pastiche of The Rape of the Lock intended for The Waste Land a scrap not worth scrapping over when his friend and mentor Ezra Pound declared its quality too far beneath its model’s to be admissible as evidence of satire’s Vorticist use as reflecting pool wherein the modern corruption of elegance could be seen as the flip side of the early 18th Century’s elegant view of corruption.

To encapsulate the double helixes of the Augustan era as unromantically as the Romantics did, it was an age of prose. Following the purge of stylistic excess undertaken by the Royal Society in the 1660’s—in England, at any rate—the “prose of the realm” became a fortiori Thomas Sprat’s “So many things, so many words,” construing with lambent finesse “an idiom devoid of all adhering even secondarily to the ‘poetical.’” Late-flowering Augustans could go on as windily as they liked and with “cheek enow” even to haul Grub Street all the way to Hampton Court, but their harpings on Aeolian instruments betrayed as little of personal loss as that elegy by Milton which made untimely drowning a passkey to lyric immortality. In their eyes the problem was not an overabundance of prose, but in an almost universal decline in readership for well-crafted verse. Writers of taste in the time of Pope found little difficulty in swallowing that division of labor between poetry and prose which the gods themselves not only sanctioned, but with a fervor like unto Olympian insistence formally decreed. Poetry was poetry, and prose—candor being honesty’s default setting—was merely prose, though that qualifier could be translated from a vice to a virtue by any number of canny means. 

 All that notwithstanding, the Romantics of Wordsworth’s generation were virtually unanimous in indicting the prosody of the period before their own as hamstrung by a temperament, a sensibility—yea, a ruling passion—that exalted “verse” above genuine poetry, the most noumenal of dingen-an-sich short of the divinity himself. Verse was inferior because next to poetic marble, it could be no more than a plaster cast—never the real thing. And that further, it was constrained by metrics and scansion (both abysmally scanting the free flight of the poet’s lyric impulse) led poets no less than readers to exalt a factitious lark-in-couplets over a full-throated songbird singing its heart out at the gates of heaven. The heroic couplet itself, for all it Horatian sonority and deference to ars longa over vita brevis, was no more than a twin-prop masking business-class accommodations with social-climbing dissimulation and the complicity of cup-bearers on loan from Central Casting. The Augustans’ view of themselves as fiddling second-stringers honoring the Heifetzes and Hubermans of Rome’s golden age with less pricey but still respectable wit of a silver one was reduced in the Romantic mind to an idée fixe centering on bells and whistles of an orchestra that long ago had ceased to play. Slice and dice it as one might, Wordsworth’s “Preface to Lyrical Ballads” remains, despite Coleridgean reservations, utterly unambiguous on the point of the previous century’s poets’ rank inability to rise to grasp and retain hold of “the vision thing.” For surely that, even the shakiest fan of Auguries of Innocence would affirm, was what real poetry was all about.

Yet, to be fair, it was not unusual for visionaries in those times to suffer abuse at the hands of sentimentalists masquerading as verse-prophets snootily thumbing their noses at anyone drawing distinctions between bonkers Blakes nattering about Zoas and batty Chattertons blathering in pseudo-Spenserese of things as little tied to this earth as the Great Chain of Unbeing Boehme and Swedenborg heard clanking among the celestial spheres. Such littering of the ramp to the Sublime sat poorly with readers weaned on verse jubilations of a Kit Smart turning the Lamb of God on a backyard spit to feed the multitude with mutton of Albion sure to stick to its ribs. Though the 18th- Century-loathing Wordsworth thought Chatterton worth a couplet—

            I thought of Chatterton, the marvelous boy,

The sleepless soul that perished in his pride 

—it was one as close to boilerplate as any toast made by Falstaff when John Barleycorn was a more intimate companion than “officious grief.” Like Peter Pans passing in the night and oblivious to the impact each would someday have on the Tintern Abbey destined someday to be reconstituted in Buena Park, California, such poetic soul-mates exemplify electable affinities far more than differences that might have undergirded the war of nerves then being waged by Lancastrian poets zonked on the Triumphs of Life against the York pretenders, their outcast cousins-in-verse, themselves knee-deep in Gray’s Elegy and awash in night thoughts better left to the young at heart.

 By the time Queen Victoria died, though, romanticism in England was casting its nets far wider than Matthew Arnold’s untidy shores, gathering in sea-waifs from the existentially non-conformist Gérard de Nerval and Friedrich Hölderlin to contrarian monsters like Poe, Hoffmann, and the ever-irredentistical Baudelaire. Likewise, in France a new breath lay on the deep whose frissons were tearing through the haunts of l’homme moyen sensuel as unstoppably as farts in an organ loft, though countermeasures were already deep in rehearsal to foil any attack on national morale. Seldom quick to react to assaults made on pudeur by mere poets, the custodians of French mores were far likelier to turn savage over affronts waged from full margin to full margin, flinging their wad of outrage at authors whose tantrums kept them to a low metaphor count when passing sentence on deviations from la gloire. French Romantic poets, however else they managed to make accommodating private posture to public scrutiny a martial art, never forswore allegiance to that prosy extrapolativeness which had long served them admirably in times of need. In this, however, they wore their Rousseauvianism on their sleeve, shrewdly hoarding its solidarity with humanity’s baser orders in small and large dollops and always under separate cover of speech dutifully labeled “of common men.” What the “aristos” spoke was held incurably arch, affected, and at heart (the only receptacle that really counted), snide—not to mention patronizing—down to its perfumed ruffles and expensive gaiters. The French Revolution, if not having quite successfully dealt aristo-culture the desired coup de grace, still left it disfigured beyond recognition, having scarred it in such a manner as to forever certify the fragility of sure things beyond all promise of 1848, 1917, 1933, or even, in its own miniature-railroading way, 1968. 

          Though it was May 1968, and not May 1848 that most starkly revealed the changes wrought upon European culture by that upheaval 180 years earlier whose effects, though visibly earth-shattering at the time, proved considerably less durable than the aristocratic hauteurs its street-rabble had labored to consign to history’s dustbin. (The next decades would show that even a scion of the tradiitional left like François Mitterand could carry himself with the disdain of a Duc d’Orleans when downwind of le riff-raff.) Yet, the resurgent imperium of Louis-Napoleon III also made cause with a new bourgeoisification of French culture by which, with the help of figures as Jacques Offenbach, the heroic values of les Parnassiens verse were corroded through deflationary dandyisms such as the noble soul-in-extremis (tempered always with deflationary irony and rendered in récit-like forms like the prose poem, for which the extended cuffnotes filling out Baudelaire’s Mon coeur mis à nu soon became the template) and the guttersnipe sublimities of a 16-year-old revisionary hot on seasoning (none too recreationally) in hell. Richard Terdiman’s Discourse/Counter-Discourse (1984) documents the tremors initiated and endured in this period with admirable if occasionally pedantic brio, though his account notably ignores the steady shifting of borders between the poetic and prosaic in the age of Balzac and Lamartine. His book shows that what stamps itself as “poetic” (say, in a passage of prose by Stendhal) meets what leaps out as prosaic in a passage of verse (by, say, Alfred de Musset) at a “constructivist” vanishing point where conveyor meets up with belt to make the product line being turned out indistinguishable from the design-model being moved along by “suits” whose fashion sense extends no further than the executive suite.

Prose, however one slices and dices it, remains intractably grounded in the sentence, and any attempt to transport it from there to a halfway house run by the cut-up methodists of verse tips the balance between poetic and prosaic inclinations over, if only by a micron or two, away from one toward the other. Safaris need not be launched into the Schwarmenveldt of the prose poem to find examples of sentential grounding being tugged every which way, either to make a point seem more pointedly pointless or less so, springing up all over the lot. It hardly matters whether such point-making via pointlessness is carried on in the spirit of an Ann Lauterbach, or in the garrulously conscriptive manner of a Wallace Stevens, or in the volcanically rumbling tones for which Dylan Thomas was famous. Being altarwise by the latter’s owl light proves finally no more rewarding or illuminating than communing with Stevens’s owls in the sarcophagus, or Lauterbach’s Cagey nightbirds, no matter how much midnight oil one burns lucubrating on such whos-without-portfolio.   

William Empson was doubtless correct when, in reviewing the writings of R. P. Blackmur in an essay published in 1955, he seized upon the lack of identifiable content which that least foolable of American critics had noted in Stevens’s poetry. However, what he and Blackmur both failed to credit was Stevens’s innate tendency to treat the iterability of the poem as of a piece with the dictational ephemerality of the simple office memo. While it might be possible to attribute this to the many years spent by Stevens writing surety bonds for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company where he was employed from 1916 until the time of his death in 1955, the innateness of that tendency was as deeply rooted in symbolist practice as it was in hieratic business’s monkeydom. Essentially a prose poet who, having served his apprenticeship to gaudy wordplay and Commedia del arte in Harmonium (1923), found in putting together collections like Parts of a World (1942) and The Auroras of Autumn (1950) a walking cure for his blues which, if not productive of much green, was serviceable enough as therapeutic andante to permit a high order of dabbling by what this Pierrot felt born to do, which was to post on notice boards of his own mind’s eye exquisite meditations on themes distinctly Valéryan, laid out in ever more blankly booming (and boomingly blank) verse. Of endlessly increasing decreasing relevance was the fact that the space in which those anecdotes, disquisitions, postcards from volcanoes were displayed was already thick with exotic travel posters, exhibition catalogues touting Gromaire and Matisse, lore relating to beasts, both real and imaginary, of which Jorge Luis Borges might’ve been a contributor, and other species of who knows what yellowing curiosities. That every now and then Stevens would smooth an edge or two of these ageing antimacassars so that their post-its in verse wouldn’t seem quite so sere or posthumous is of consequence only to those who believe the jury deliberating his ultimate place in American letters is still out.

One thing at any rate is certain: Stevens stands as the absolute antipodes of W. C. Williams, the Objectivist heretic willing to take the whole of European literature off the books where American writing is concerned, and with an insouciance that makes even Walt Whitman’s appear mealy-mouthed. A local variety of what even by Saturday Review standards is a hothouse bloom, the Stevensian stemwinder emerged from out the nowhere whence emerged the Emersonian essay, the Longfellow pop-up epic, whether of Finnish or Acadian provenance, and the James Russell Lowell panegyric on nobody-in-particular. Until certain influential critics took up its cudgels (mostly after the patent holder’s death), it seemed bound for the same terminal as his predecessors’ versions of the form, despite the musicality of some of its broadband. Left behind by this giant of a man in fee were a handful of genuinely unique lyrics composed late in life; a number of others, mostly of conventional length, as well as some justly celebrated anthology pieces like “Sunday Morning” and “Esthétique du Mal” running somewhat longer; many more of what could be called “character pieces,” with lines or even passages of enormous astuteness dotting their wordscapes; and still others—many others—of the stemwinder variety alluded to earlier (“Auroras to Autumn,” “Transport to Summer,” and “Notes toward a Supreme Fiction” being the three most notable ) which were to give Randall Jarrell and critics like him the hives and conniptions. All in all, the Stevensian correspondent breeze still   had a quarter-century or more in its Oz-bellows to run after the poet’s death, mostly in boutiques frequented by Ashbery imitators, but that approach to things, never much lauded by any but those determined to be rid of whatever Marjorie Perloff was buying, was pretty much vieux chapeau by the late ‘80s and ‘90s. The replacement for it tended to be what Alan Williamson, himself a poet, called the “poetry of the sentence,” a mode achieving boldest relief in the verse of C. K. Williams, already been cited in defense of the poetic line which extends to both the “hyper-long” and the longingly hyper. One interesting use for this device may be seen in “The Nail,” a poem that clears a space for itself by not letting the merely supernumerary determine its line-length, though the invoking of tutelary spirits in whose name naming since Adam has proceeded is high on its agenda of time-fillers:

            Some dictator or other had gone into exile, and now reports were coming

                        about his regime,

            the usual crimes, torture, false imprisonment, cruelty and corruption,

                        but then a detail:

            that the way his henchmen had disposed of enemies was by hammering

                        nails into their skulls,

            Horror, then, what mind does after horror, after that first feeling that

                        you’ll never catch your breath,

            mind imagines—how not to be annihilated by it?—the preliminary tap,

                        feels it in the tendon of the hand,

            feels the way you do with your nail when you’re fixing something, making

                        something, shelves, a bed;

the first light tap to set the slant. And then the slightly harder tap, to                          embed the tip a little more . . . 

Lines like these might seem sentential, but the fact that they do so only perfunctorily render that impression at best marginally valid. The oblique angularity of Williams’s syntax makes stunning bank shots off nodes of understatement, while leaving other, more salient lumps and masses to clutter thought the way a video game’s tactilities infuse leisure with addictive feedback. Finding himself ushered by this poem into a confidence he neither desires nor feels comfortable with, the reader quickly learns that the trick behind Williams’s approach to billiards is to leave the table of green fields so encumbered with blocked lines of vision that the next shot has to be made with not a single pocket open. What establishes “The Nail” as verse rather than prose manqué is the rhythmic verve with which it accomplishes the snookering of its own possibilities, artificially compounded as that process might seem.

Of course, such hustler-like tactics occur at the opposite end of the spectrum from where the circular viciousness dogging the poetic impasses of a Paul Célan like a dark familiar. Given the habit of that poet to double the strands of genetic material binding each of his poems with intertwined helixes of dissociation, even his reductions of the tragic to German-language Escher sketches of loss have little of the game-player’s preoccupation with losing about them.

But there and there precisely appears the cursor on either side of which the occasioning of paraphrasable texts finds its poetic prompt. Poetry can traffic in elaborate detail but it cannot imbibe the sum total of its specificities neat. Should it even try to do so, one should not be surprised at the sudden coming into play of a comic mutantcy the issuance of which being something in the nature of a fishhead atop a human torso with the entire ensemble articulating some such visual pun as “Salmon Rushdie.” Unsure whether, as a hybrid, it is prosifed verse or versified prose, all this chimera can do is ask over and over, “Which way is it to the Caucus Race?”

    To conclude this phase of the tour of the roundabouts, let’s just say that C. K. Williams’s poetry, for all its gutsy transcendence of easy moral stances (the stock in trade of a Philip Levine or Robert Pinsky) inhabits a recognizably human planet, and Célan’s, for all the miraculous stents applied to what stops the heart of the heart of the poet’s own inner country, does not. Which is not at all to suggest that Williams is a more “together” poet than Célan. While respectful of the talent that brought Love Poems and Poems about Love into the world, to even imply such a thing would be to put Houdini and eternal recurrence on the same plane. Some comparisons kill through their own outlandishness, their inadvertence resulting in a double murder. As with an algebraic equation in which both sides equal zero, the splaying of unknowns across a crevass of noughts confronts nothingness with itself in a recognition scene that is both blinding and self-cancelling. Imagine the Medusa catching her own glance in a mirror and simultaneously watching everything turn to stone but her own reflection.     
	
### Wrought Fiery-Hot Upon a Grillwork of Transformations

Western Art by Deborah Greger. Penguin Poets Series, 2004. $18.

As Reviewed By: James Rother

Debora Greger is one of those poets who can’t help obsessing about art’s hidden agenda—the one lurking beneath layers of veneration which for centuries have surrounded art with more awe and wonder than anything outside of revealed religion. Forget what great paintings seem to be saying, fixationists like Greger insist, and concentrate on what they reveal of themselves as they go about the business of unmasking (or, as some might say, of flaying the hell out of) the world, the flesh and the devil. The question such poets want answered is: Do works of art tell questing humans what they need to know, or only what connoisseurs’ vanity demands, so that what is less than marvelous in humanity can be palliated by the “greatness of art”? Glance at any piece of classic art, they argue, and what do you see? What the Clement Greenbergs and Sir Herbert Reads have taught you to see: surfaces residuating into backwashes of detail, themselves but mercurial aggregates of cultural particles owing more to the viewer’s own patterning than the artist whose name is on the painting. The framed thing staring back at us is nothing but a speculum which, if sufficing as Hamlet’s “brief and abstract chronicle of the time,” is still flat and two-dimensional as any garden-variety looking glass.

Western Art, Debora Greger’s seventh collection of poems and the first since Movable Islands appeared back in 1980, attempts to plumb (with only intermittent cogency and coherence, one regrets to say) the same mirror of art Baudelaire notoriously ransacked for ravelings of beauty in such probative studies as his accounts of the Salons of 1845, 1846, 1855, and 1859. Though having little in common with that fractious man of gall, Greger, like him, spurns art’s sacred and sublime offices for the Loreleis they all too frequently prove to be. Her quarrel with art’s shortcomings may now and then decline into willfulness bordering on vulgarity, but it can also come across (when the temptation to turn the wrath of the biblical Judith on paintings and plaster casts of Holofernes is indulged) as evidence that a poet unwilling to let “Great Masters” chic cloud her trusty female intuition is in our midst. Trust neither the tale nor its teller, her poems seem to be saying, for art has small commerce with trust and sits for even less of it being siphoned off to teach us about it. Stripped of its pieties, art seems concerned with little more than catching homo pudens at his disingenuous best—or worst, depending on one’s gift for cynicism. Staging wardrobe malfunctions for the snobs accustomed to seeing things nude rather than buck naked is what art has always been about, or at least what it used to be about before it went all wacky and expressionist. Homologies linking a Géricault to a Jackson Pollock might be adduced ad nauseam, but who could possibly think them worth the highlighting? No, what drags us back to museums like hashish addicts to bongs is not the frisson of High Art, but getting down in the muck of controversies roiling over this or that degree of dèshabille’s inadvertence. The scandal that converted Manet’s Olympia into a Warhol-esque Olympiade has shown greater legs since that portrait’s unveiling than the model herself. If the history of art teaches us anything at all it’s that a nipple exposed here, a crotch nearly glimpsed there, and before long, art’s whole pornucopia is ululating in spasms of long-sequestered horniness. And not just in the manner paraded in a Goya’s Naked Maja or the Fontainebleau ‘Diana’. When truthfully revealed, the handmaids of art emerge as akin not to the muses or graces of refined sensibility but to the Janet Jacksons and Sharon Stones of social flight from such enervating regimes of those of taste and morality[private]

But that is decidedly not the wrong tree Greger’s Western Art is avid to bark up. The process of unmasking that her “Western art” undergoes is both subtler than the “erotics” Susan Sontag passionately embraced—in her ‘60s manifesto, “Against Interpretation”—and a good deal less self-trumpeting. In Greger’s two-part poem (“after Tiepolo”) “The Trompe l’Oeil of History,” the effrontery of art acts as a prompt launching the poet into a critique of the liberties taken in one painting where the yoking of love-making and war-making (in the persons of two notorious lovers) is not to be written off the stage of history as no more than an occasion for an artist’s waking dream. The diptych’s first part, “The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra,” suggests that what is most captivating about a painting is not what is seen there, but rather what isn’t:

Because the painter knew that history,
when it happened, happened in Venice,
it’s on the steps of the Riva

that Cleopatra meets Antony’s ship.
And it’s not so long ago, merely the Renaissance,
so high it smells like the Grand Canal,

which lies hidden in the fresco
behind her froth-white, useless horse,
his unseaworthy, shell-like ship.

In its ghostly ballroom, you stand,
feeling underdressed, and study the painted ceiling,
the peeling walls, waiting to have seen something . . .

a rustle of silk vanished in a forest of spears?

For Greger, the essence of art is to be found in that ellipsis tapering to a question mark at the end of her poem and indicating idiosyncrasy in the course of being overtaken by the enigmatic. But is it the Queen of Egypt’s idiosyncrasy that is giving way to the enigmatic or is it the painter’s, or, least likely among clashing possibilities, the poet’s own? The second part of Greger’s diptych, “The Feast of Cleopatra,” though lengthier than the first, muddies the waters more rashly:

The past is in the next room,
the painter would have us believe,
and the food’s better—

a dog still waits at the feet of its mistress,
like love for table scraps.
But Cleopatra has called only for a glass

of vinegar, she’s so extravagant.
holding a pearl earring,
she reaches for the goblet,

ready to prove to Antony,
girded in armor for this battle across the table—
whatever it was she proved.

But not quite yet.
Pliny still wants to know of the pearl,
do we get the most bodily pleasure

from the luxuries that cost a life?
Where before they only dove for pearls,
now the poor divers desire them, he says.

See how a jewel attends a lady like a slave.
How a pearl warms to the skin.
This he calls natural history

for want of a better word. But not yet.
Not yet does love begin at the beginning,
acidly, its slow dissolve.

The letch of such verse for the quick kill is as promiscuous as its formal dispersion of accents and emphases. Auden in his prime could toss off trifles like these between breakfast and the first whisky of the day, but his modus operandi was always to make seem as difficult as possible what was actually as uncomplicated as falling (no lapsarian pun intended) off a log. Greger’s personal m.o. snips along the same dotted line as, say, that poet’s “Musée des Beaux Arts,” though it balks at praising artists for any display of wisdom not claimable by their subjects. (Western Art contains a three-part “Musée des Beaux Arts,” which, though walking knowingly over Auden’s grave, is likely to raise few goose bumps on the hide of his anointed.) Her Tiepolitan Antony and Cleopatra act on no one’s lack of initiative (or as yet un-occurring failure of nerve) but their own; their eternity of love looped into a grisly ampersand would be utterly inaccessible to similar lovers with different names even if such existed, which they don’t. The “trompe l’oeil of history” Greger references in the title of her diptych trumps the eye as well as deceives it by falsely contemporizing the fact of the lovers’ posing as though for a postcard of Renaissance Venice in which stunt doubles substitute for their fabular counterparts. Passion in the painting of which she speaks remains as palpably out of reach as it does on Keats’s Grecian urn. But so is any establishable meaning or suitably elevating purpose, and art that takes account of neither is not really the art we’re used to rhapsodizing about—or is it?

Who knows where art comes from? Try as we might to plumb its wells and not-so-wells, to root about where nonsense plumbers of every persuasion have unsuccessfully roto-rooted since Plato’s cave presented aesthetics with its first clogged latrine, we can’t for the life of us avoid what every spelunker with a light in his hat has had staring him in the face from Day One. Nobody knows where art springs from, and when all is said and done, the findings of a Camille Paglia are no more—or less—credible than the gyroscopic fits of a W. B. Yeats or the feral dissemblings of a Ted Hughes. Having said this, not a single starry-eyed prospector after fool’s gold is likely to be diverted or deflected from following his hunches as to where all that glittering might point, no matter how failure-ridden the track record of all such quests has proved in the past. Doubtless it’s tempting to see what pans out when with each new generation, every hock shop and flea market this side of the Kasbah yields new decoder rings for cracking this Arethusan conundrum. And it seems to make very little difference how the new finds are trotted out. Whether gussied up in mummy wrap (out of Yeats’s A Vision) or gleamingly simonized with paste from some Jungian ball of wax—all that is required is for the ducks of any fresh hypothesis to line up smartly, to look lively, and to not quack on key like a flotilla of decoys.

Which is another way of saying that poets who lack the windmills to tilt at at home (pace Blake and Yeats) should not blast away from blinds hammered together at home. The pretentious pronouncements made by amateurs of this lore, those knights of mortar and pestle eager as Faust to see their souls swapped for a mere whiff of aqua fortis, deserve the negative cachet they’ve earned among skeptics: that of tent-show pitches, for the credulous only. Yet Greger’s unflagging devotion to the cause of nailing down art’s originary source serves only to support the old saw that fixations increase the grip they exert on us the more aware we are of the hold they exert on us. She can’t fool us with occasional departures from the Rome, Verona, and Venice of her favorite artists whose paintings obsess her, or from the Golden Horn of those pli selon pli-ers whose tales goaded Alexander to conquer Persia and India—even when Greger deserts those places for parts all too known and bearing code names like “the verge of Florida” or Archer City, Texas. For that matter, neither the intimations of mortality summoned by the Tar Pits of La Brea—nor the fossils of conjugal incompatibility unearthed by one estranged spouse for his or her opposite number over dinner—neither of these gambits can distract from Greger’s real ploy in this game of noughts and crosses, which is to stick it to art with art’s own cache of stilettos and poignards. There might be game afoot in Western Art, but it isn’t the sort broached by the naturalist John Muir in the epigraph to the book’s fourth part: “In my interview with a Sierra bear, we were frightened and embarrassed, both of us, but the bear’s behavior was better than mine.” Neither is it the wedding-cake “alligator bride and groom” that rise up to threaten marriage in the poem of that title. In the mesh of itineraries fleshed out by destiny in Greger’s troposphere, there are no detours, no lines of demarcation effectively separating the Florida of her own residential acquaintance from the Rome of looser collective memory. Or the ever-temporizing City of the Angels from eternally contemporary Venice or Byzantium. Or for that matter, all of them from the lush (if interior) grazings offered by any of the better Manhattan museums. Viz. her poem “Annunciation, with Missing Panel”:

For her, all such loci are party to a single archetypal conundrum: Why is rootedness in art thought to be our only hope for moral enlargement outside of religion, when it may be no more than an elaborately carved popsicle stick to which our civilization, rapidly succumbing to global warming, frigidly clings as its insecurity blanket.

That’s right: insecurity blanket. Centuries of cant to the contrary notwithstanding, something there is indeed that doesn’t love a wall, to approximate Robert Frost’s inimitable lockjaw idiom. And especially when it’s in a museum and tricked out with all the folderol of the beaux arts in excelsis. Greger feels that the real mystery of art lies in its power to further excoriate our personal anxieties, to take what is discreditable in ourselves and project it, somehow inverted, as the triumphal glory of pettiness, all neatly transcended. Her Rembrandt is a Panzaic recorder of quixotic ignoblesses obliges gone funny in the head. Requiring chamber pots to helmet their willfulness with tempered resolution, they trumpet reveille to the sentry policing the costume fancies we all first surrendered to as children:

. . . How he liked to dress up:
a helmet like a chamber pot, with matching gorget.

A plume with a mind of its own. Upholstered in velvet,
chained in gold, he painted himself into the past—

but couldn’t get the light right, as the x-ray showed,
and put in a poodle, desperation kinking every curl.

Greger’s Gainsborough, similarly cross-grained with distraction, transubstantiated his imperial boredom into a corpus of aristocratic or otherwise privileged hosts whom he portrayed grudgingly in brown study after brown study as the veritable peat moss of a gentry too deep in its own accoutered pride to see the handful of dust staring back at them out of a painted mirror:

After a certain age, who can bear to look out the window?
Time on his hands like paint, he painted himself

in the muddy colors he loved most of all.
His face won’t bear the weight of his looking

for much longer, but he doesn’t know that yet.
Death, his last patron, will say of it,

Can’t you see? There’s something wrong with the eyes.

Always something wrong, as though art were a gradient of error needing no more than an ascension by some plenary gratuitousness to have its subjects forever revealed as misshapen or even grotesque. With a Cézanne, the problematic more and more revealed itself to be hands, clumsily drawn and falling off the draughtsman’s table line like pre-school plaster moulds; in the case of a Chagall, it turned out to be lips; and chez Fragonard, furbelows protruding at an angle out of sync with attendant airs and graces were enough to send perfectionists scrambling toward the first Watteau in range. Greger doesn’t point an accusing finger at such egregiousness of manner or mien. Rather, she embraces it as the saving dis-grace of an adequacy alone capable of keeping the artistic enterprise out of Chapter XI. If scarcely Blake’s divine love rechanneled contrariwise, then the degree to which art is never less than human remains for Greger one that other enterprises cannot lay claim to. Even so, while the characteristic Dasein of art might pack a wallop, its particulars tend to disperse with disturbing vagueness into those discrepancies of suffering for whose disposition W. H. Auden accorded infallibility to his “great masters” in that poem of his discussed earlier. Indeed, Auden’s none-too-cautious poem represents an anti-matter to the matière comprise of Western art—or at any rate, that version of it to which Debora Greger’s book title alludes.

The foothold from which Greger overlooks the abyss of artistic errancy is her own idiosyncratically concocted stance as self-appointed cicerone of what proves a purposely misguided tour of exemplary cultural sites. In it, she is at pains to show us where metamorphosis wrought by artists (rather than by gods filling out Ovid’s officious forms with mythic boilerplate) has had its way with unearned felicity. She also shows how the rumplings of contentedness have been crimped—via not always welcome make-overs—by the intervention of special pleaters in the affairs of reformable matter. Not by art alone, but by the partnering of complicity bordering on the criminal (marriage) with criminality bordering on complicity (“significant other”-ing). Yes, domesticity, whether operating under the proprietary gaze of the Sacraments or in the loosely conscripted form of mutually useful cohabitation—the chump change of sexual currency in the Mariolatric West—is still the Wal-Mart-ish monogram, His & Hers. When the facts on the ground, and not just the druthers of Greger’s will to power, have been totted up, there is almost as much about demeaned engenderment said in Western Art as about art’s having conscripted the vanity of human wishes into a pride. To confirm this we need only turn to a poem Greger decouples from its own couplets to make a siding out of end-pieces, “The Palace at Four a.m.”:

And then one morning the courtship is over.
No longer does the male hold forth at four A.M.

to impress the female enough to mate.
Now only the note of alarm is given voice

by the blackbird or its cheeky, petrified young:
a chink in the air—as if stone were being dressed,

the way you mend a wall in an old cathedral town,
the local church too soft to last. Almost fifty,

you wake almost alone, in a foreign country.
That’s not a husband next to you, it’s loneliness. . . .

Yeats’s Byzantium is held similarly off-limits to women, who are plainly there to inspire, and not be inspired by, spirits empowered to make ravished virgins of those unprepossessed poets clueless enough to claim their gender as incontrovertibly male. Women can only ply the causeways of possession like streetwalkers in an Islamic exorcism of public desire, far removed from that visionary exclusiveness ironically furnished to Yeats by a consort skilled in automatic writing and sporting the—by British standards, at least—butch moniker of George. “That is no country for women,” Gregor somewhat caustically paraphrases “Sailing to Byzantium” in her own “Flying to Byzantium.” “In the streets / of Istanbul men strutted like pigeons.” “Like saints surrounded by gold in the old mosaics,” she writes, “they wanted to sell me something.” Down but not out, she wanders, an evictee of her own bemusement, gored not a little by the ox of alien masculinity she sees everywhere staking out bourns of lordliness in what was once the nominal haunt of the emperor Constantine.

In the church of St. Savior, the sainted men

painted on the wall looked down on me.
What could I do but walk beneath their gaze,
I who’d paid to look, not to pray? Over their heads,
a girl was given away to priests in the Temple.

Even higher up, an angel brought her bread,
since she would be needed later in the story,
being the young virgin Mary.
A paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick—

a girl at a traffic light at midnight
took the smirched rag she was supposed to smear
our windshield with, and wound it instead
around a fence post in play. Into a doll

whose face could hardly be seen for the veils . . . .

How well does Debora Greger the poet account for herself on such uneven ground? She is certainly no greenhorn tourist in this oft-frequented neck of the woods, having turned in no fewer than six full-dress performances before Western Art, none of which shows any sign of wanting to veer into less intense neighborhoods. (The title of her last book was God.) Greger’s virtues have a wry way with commonplaces masquerading as “signs taken for wonders”:

There was a note in pencil for Ezra Pound.
Pink ballet slippers in a plastic bag
hung in mid-air from Diaghilev’s grave.
Brodsky didn’t have a headstone yet,

just a few pebbles, balanced,
out of respect, on a wooden cross.
A cigarette and a whisky bottle lay in the dirt,
songbirds in the cypress making light of it. . .

(“Island of the Dead”)

There is an uncompromising way of not forcing metaphor to do the job of mere similitude—

The rest of the saints looked carefully
at nothing, the view from the back row
blocked by the haloes in front, arrayed
like Sunday-best plates in a china cabinet. . .

(“Island of the Last Judgment”)

—and an honesty willing to forgo, if necessary, the ear candy of sweet sound when direct statement cannot feasibly be fitted with a cadence, as in “Poetry and Sleep”:

What did Keats know about sleep or poetry?
He’d never seen an elephant
take a nap. Merely lying down
took the elaborate effort of a poet:

you almost saw the thought occur
behind the massif of forehead and then
set out to reach the extremities by dark. . . .

She can also, when it’s called for, rhyme featly with the better Ransomites on this side of the generational divide separating pre-World War II- from post-Vietnam-era poets:

High in the dark light we call weak,
God has six days. He’s young, smooth-cheeked—

and already something’s not to his taste,
an angel, as always, in too great haste

to roll the earth back into night
before he can say, “Wait. There should be light.”

On the negative side of the ledger one can point to a whole clutch of glitches that from the stylistic point of view are either annoying or expungeable—or both—to varying degrees. Not infrequently in Greger’s verse, cuteness marries up to elegant cliché with an almost casual arrogance:

Backs straight, we sat in the dorm-mother’s room,
ankles crossed, and listened to the voice of God:
Walter Cronkite read the evening news. . . .

And with comparable morganatic brusqueness, the mating of yellow journalist with retro-agitproperty clerk:

Worthless, my degree in art.
What would Madame Nhu, late of Saigon, do,
that deposed dictator’s wife
who said you could sleep on the run,

but only in a couture coat?. . .

Would her degree in art have seemed as futile, one wonders, if the object of scorn were Imelda Marcos authorizing on-the-run naps in Gucci shoes? From the poet’s standpoint, are long-lost anti-guerrilla wars better grist for the mill if they awaken memories of solidarity on the left or if they revisit militant screw-ups perpetrated by the right? Again, only the Shadow knows, and this time with Hollow Men-style dryness of tone is equivocating.

On his death bed, Molière reputedly was asked whether dying was difficult. Icily he responded that dying was easy, comedy was hard. Debora Greger, on the basis of a careful reading of Western Art, appears to attribute her own difficulties with life’s comedy of errors to art’s rank inability to prepare us for the worst in all that is not art, which is to say all not magically invertible by the looking glass enterable (in the manner set by Cocteau in Orphée) through a picture frame. Among the worst in this regard (and dispatched with a glibness that is of not just the flambéd but the flimflambéd variety) are the booby traps of domesticity, those rabbit holes of “significant otherness” down which most of us, through much of our lives, repeatedly tumble and which never, or almost never, open out onto satisfactions greater than those a mustard seed might augur lacking a parable to bear fruit in. If the husband and wife imbroglio is successfully averted, then—short of loneliness courted depressingly as dark familiar—our fate, starkly pointed to by Greger in poem after poem on the theme of failed domesticity, is to confer flat-lining revenance on years of local cohabitation.

Which is not to suggest that Greger’s verse reduces to such knee-jerk runes of revisionist feminism as “Eve was framed.” Their history of providing the office doors of female professors with a Dantean admonishment to males with knockers on their minds to abandon all hope before crossing the transom is not really at issue here. Greger’s art is a notably acidic one: it has the etcher’s gift for inscribing the serpentines of moral allegory on Dürer-esque surfaces where the malleable and the fictile need to be scrupulously controlled. As a result, she is drawn to those forms of art which, from Roman times to the Renaissance and beyond, kept themselves honest by bearing the image of mortality’s sting into the world to combat the blandishments of flesh and devil. Despite the solvency it has acquired within first paganism’s, and then Judeo-Christianity’s crucible, such art failed notably to accomplish in situ what historians and connoisseurs of later times overgenerously allowed to be an empowering contextuality. This, implies Greger, has proved unfortunate for art as well as its gullible constituency because in the final analysis, art’s “aura” is nothing but context. Western art’s centuries-long superintendence of art culture, those repositories of the human image from which we draw breath of spirituality, reduces to little more than the contextual management of ulterior no less than anterior spaces of remonstrance whereby all who contemplate art’s productions are furnished with a museum wall for the broadening as well as the relativizing of their own perspective on the world. Greger, if the vulgarity can be forgiven, is determined to be more broader than broad in not countenancing any of the claims traditionally voiced by artists, who believe that art socially and politically enables people who, outside of art’s realm, are content to see themselves as merely empowered. In “Artist Unknown,” portrait miniatures are interrogated for any incriminating evidence they might be harboring that their central unknown is not in fact the artist who painted them:

In the last row, dime-size, gold-encased, hung two
that were all eye: the eye of the beloved,

whoever she once was. Was the guard’s back turned?
You had to be eye to eye to see that the iris

was just another earth. Aqueous humor blue,
green continents adrift: the world was tiny

two hundred years ago, all love inconsequent.
O my pretty unknown, to whose watch chain

were you fobbed? To what did you turn a blind blue eye? . . .

This is cross-talk in the by now familiar idiom of Ashbery’s Parmigianino-inspired “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.” But it does go the doyen of such contortive post-modernizing one better by refusing to mix alembications of a naturalizing personal cult with distillations of a more fomentive, not to mention fermentive cast. Indeed, the conceit broached in Greger’s poem luxuriates not all that remotely from the Crashaw-esque, both as a trompe-l’oeil of masculinist derogation and optical sophistry as bizarrely lachrymosed in that poet’s super-mannerist poem “The Weeper,” and as a wrong-end-of-the-telescope airing of the truism “It’s a small world.” In Greger’s baroque boutique, we are light years removed from the notion of the musée sans murs (museum without walls) floated some years ago by the French novelist and art historian André Malraux. For him, the entire world, having inherited the aura-less estate of unlimited reproduction obsessed upon first by Baudelaire and later by Walter Benjamin, was a fortiori a vast representational gallery equipped with neither exhibitive surfaces nor divisive partitions. Malraux’s para-critical fluxions aside, what’s lamentably absent from Western Art is its author’s registered shock at the paucity of concern for what endangers the irreplaceably human in the life we all live in—what might best be called the shadow of art’s engaging dissimulations. It all coalesces rather too easily on the page, this obloquy of hers with irony, with pastiche, with disabling tropes in general. Too pat and easily rechargeable are the cells of distemper for one unable to be shocked at how little the bomb-maker is alarmed by the destructiveness of the devices she arms, and not just the masterworks they aim to atomize, are intended to wreak. That they not infrequently fizzle, sputter and conk out is altogether beside their point and hers. They were brought into the world of Western Art to detonate certain ancient assumptions about the donativity of the work bequeathed us by the Great Masters, and it is on that basis that they should be judged and not any other.

Perhaps Greger’s rage to disorder was somewhat mollified (hence the impression of patness) by the disinclination to credit poets with the same disruptive capability as painters, cathedral architects, and the rest of the supernal riffraff with which bastions of unutterable splendor like Renaissance Venice, Rome, and Istanbul abounded. As it is, Western Art retraces an Oregon Trail of contumelies that the Lewises and Clarks of wormwood historicism—John Ruskin, Bernard Berenson, Wilhelm Wörringer, E. H. Gombrich, to name but a few—have already marked with poison pens. All of these are known for having toiled in gold fields, which Greger’s hard-to-conceal self-gratulatoriness would have us believe were not thrown open to lucrative speculation before her own deadwood historicizing.

In the face of such canards it is perhaps best to cry duck and leave it at that. The art historians mentioned above were at least able to take art as it comes and to be unwilling to further worry it to death with mementi mori in excess of its own earned right to die in species et in décor—which is to say, removed from dusty archives and reintroduced into the light of day, its superb heartlessness the better to be appreciated. Poets should not be shortchanged in such a general indictment of compassion or a failure in foreseeing the feminist Atlantis raised at last in Camille Paglia’s time and our own. Doesn’t Greger know that it is to poets much more than painters that most of us flock when the heat of things cools down and disabling entropy looms? Painters might in the manner of a Tiepolo gild a way to the Truth lined with clouds and back-lit plenitudes; but it is poets with the chutzpah to counter the not-to-be-seen with the not-to-be-left-unspoken, who, trailing rap-sheets of glory like scoops destined for a celestial City Room, we repeatedly rely on to acquaint us with places of which none can say, as Gertrude Stein famously did of Oakland, California, “There is no there there.” Only they have the courage to broach the audible without the visual as backup, and they usually have the grace (responsible as they are for having conducted us there) to let us find the way out by ourselves, offering neither spilt religion nor volumes teeming with chain-chucking masses to aid us in our transit. Their quite singular virtue is to leave us very much under the power of our own sense—call it a delusion, if you like—of having had one more than could actually be counted depart with us from whatever or wherever it was we had been led to, even if that he, she, or it could no longer be confirmed as a live presence at our journey’s end. Painting, sculpture, even architecture cannot in any real sense accomplish this. Only language, wrought fiery-hot upon a grillwork of transformations themselves ulteriorly verbal, can discover alloys of temperament and mettle able to resist reality’s solvents. Even if only for the briefest of times.

That, I feel, is what has gone A.W.O.L. from Debora Greger’s otherwise diverting take on those who hardily compensate for the inhuman condition in Western Art. Still, in all fairness to this engagingly thoughtful poet, no one is suggesting hers to be the only verse notable for having had its spinal taproots take a powder when the going got rough. In the gutless wonderland of today’s publishing world, books like Western Art serve a purpose by filling the gap left by potentially more substantive contributions to the art of poetry being lured into more financially rewarding media and venues. Too many poets rush into print having achieved no more than a prosy cover story whose wiry artfulness fails to redeem an overall sponginess beyond any possibility of being, as the saying goes, fixed in the mix. I would be less than honest if I pretended, for the sake of courtesy, or of going along to get along, that Western Art deserves praise precisely for not being the kind of book that cries out for the sort of praise usually accorded books hanging “unpopular” notions of what constitutes sacred cows out to dry. While there’s nothing exceptionable about being saddled with that kettle of fish (to mix a metaphor unfixably), it’s hardly cause for anyone to rush out and buy helpings of the bouillabaisse for shipment to one’s friends. To invert the old carnie putdown, Debora Greger’s book earns the complimentary cigar, but not the accolade “good” that ordinarily precedes its withholding.

### The Interpres-sive Lowell
  By James Rother January 1, 2004 Featured, January 2004: Robert Lowell Special Issue, Reviews
Collected Poems of Robert Lowell. Edited by Frank Bidart and David Gewanter. Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, 2003. 1181 pages. $45.

As Reviewed By: James Rother

Three years ago the Collected Poems everyone was talking about was J. D. McClatchy’s James Merrill; last year it was Czeslaw Milosz’s; and in 2003, the duple bounty of Paul Keegan‘s Ted Hughes and Frank Bidart’s and David Gewanter’s Robert Lowell is the talk of many towns. The Lowell settles a silt bed of poetic sediment that will take a good deal longer than a memorial year to sift through and assess. In addition to nearly one thousand pages of verse (including seven appendices, one of which contains the entire Land of Unlikeness, Lowell’s first book of poems, never reprinted in its original form), this griffin-like volume incorporates 150 pages of editorial notes, an index of titles, a glossary, and a detailed chronology of the poet’s life. Staring down at my copy with its obtruding folds and slips, I feel more like a dragonslayer than a reviewer. But the career of this poet was like that. Preoccupied with its own bashing and thrashing about, it managed to breathe fire at both ends.

[private]The Lowell took its own good time in the depositing, but then the Boston poet, like his fellow chaostician, Friedrich Nietzsche, always seemed a trifle posthumous. Though he may have slipped off to Erebus nearly 30 years ago-1977, to be exact-what was felt by many to be missing in both him and his poetic output is still very much with us, if that’s not to stand a venerable cliché on its head. We continue to feel his loss, but as the obverse-in itself quite strange-of the underlife which his poetry reveals as the novitiate of a long process of self-gathering and expenditure. That is to say, we experience it like an absence slicing through us, a wind bringing further devastation to an already sandblasted wasteland. Or, to backflip the simile, like a storm illuminating blooms as nightmarishly thick as those dominating the garden of Sebastian Venable’s aunt in Tennessee Williams’s play (and film) Suddenly Last Summer. Though never quite as quotable as the verse of some other poets-even those whose work was less bitingly memorable than his-Lowell’s lines can, and often do, grab us by our ganglions and toss us mercilessly about. Not with the force of nine-inch nails driven into our self-composure (though this was certainly the preference of the early Lowell), but with an energizing crackle that finds its way to the roots of short hairs as well as long. Then, too, there’s the unmistakable sound of a Lowell poem as it strikes the innermost ear: a threshing sound that at once suggests the whooshing of looms and the throbbing of Narns (though not always in synch). And off to one side of that, cresting the undertow of ambient noise, is the inevitable sound of iron being pumped-of Wirklichkeit being Schwarzeneggered into myth.

Such hyping of reality is not something that American poets have needed much coaxing to pile on to. The joy in excessive wattage, in coloring what is already toadstoolish with bluebottle rant and lavalamp-shaded hyperbole, is one of the dominant genes of modernism that has proved resistant to any number of pesticides. True, the 20th Century American night is always darkest before dawn, but the sunrise that follows is small comfort because it is utterly hapless, helpless and hopeless at countering the darkness within. As a writer, Lowell seemed to have learned without coaching what cockeyed optimists like F. Scott Fitzgerald needed a lifetime of illusion puncturing to comprehend: that the dark night of the soul, heart-stopping as it can be at three o’clock in the morning, is just as likely to cause apoplexy when descending unannounced at three in the afternoon. The torturous lucubrations dotting volumes like History (1973) do much to make this clear, though bouts of transparency yield in the earlier Lowell to glazings over that boast the limpidity of, at best, clarified butter:

    I bring the child of Idumean night,
    a black thing, bleeding, stumbling-its wings are plucked.
    Through the window’s gold and aromatic fire,
    panes frosted by night, alas, and wearisome,
    the dawn throws itself upon my sacred lamp-
    palms! It reveals this relic to its father;
    I try to cheer it with a hostile smile
    That chills our blue and sterile solitude. . . .

Here, the machinations may be Mallarmean, as its title suggests (“Mallarmé 2: Gift of a Poem”), but the obsessions are strictly Lowell’s, the loneliness of that poet’s azur notwithstanding. That child of Idumean night is everywhere in his poeticizing, parsing his alphabet of horror in symbols that dip their wick as little in the philosopher Frege’s Sinn as in its flagrant Other, Bedeutung. What drives a Lowell poem is the same engine that kicks in to shift a dream, with Harley-like vroom, into cauchemar pure and simple; and for that, both sense and meaning as conventionally construed must give way to contra naturam‘s bill of particulars, as in the poem “Unwanted,” from Day by Day (1977):

    Too late, all shops closed-
    I alone here tonight on Anabuse,
    surrounded only by iced white wine and beer,
    like a sailor dying of thirst on the Atlantic-
    one sip of alcohol might be death,
    death for joy.
    Yet in this tempting leisure,
    good thoughts drive out bad;
    causes for my misadventure, considered
    for forty years too obvious to name,
    come jumbling out
    to give my simple autobiography a plot.

A common, perhaps over-charitable way of viewing Lowell has coincided with the poet’s own take on the work of his friend and one-time mentor, Allen Tate. Back in 1959, he remarked in a brief memoir, “Visiting the Tates,” that the poems of this Southern poet, “all of them, even the slightest, are terribly personal,” but that “[out] of splutter and shambling come a killing eloquence.” Like Tate, he had difficulty keeping his hands off his own finished work, seeing it always as not so much completed as in a state of corrective suspension. And, as with the author of “Ode to the Confederate Dead,” he was an endless recycler of already written and published work. Still, and rather unfortunately, the transfer of qualities between these two not wholly dissimilar poets fails to connect at both ends of the exchange. From the very onset of Lowell’s career, critics have fallen all over themselves apologizing for the various destabilizations introduced into his tenuously executed highwire act. They have ignored the not infrequent breakdowns in meaning and failures to communicate beyond the semaphores of ruin, frantically waved, which do the work of sense in more poems in volumes like Lord Weary’s Castle (1946) and The Mills of the Kavanaughs (1951) than his claque care to admit. It’s not that there isn’t a fine intelligence deploying those intricate metaphysical quadrilles of his, in which antinomies and self-devouring casuistries are put through tortuously Scholastic paces. It’s just that the superintendence cuts in and out like a cell phone passing through tunnels, reducing the poet’s anxiety (expressed in all those unstated “Can you hear me now?”‘s) to a child’s garden of insecurities. The almost unthinkable failure of contemporary verse anthologists to include such pieces as “After the Surprising Conversions,” “The Holy Innocents,” “Colloquy in Black Rock” and “The Death of the Sheriff” in their collections speaks volumes, and not just about the knee-jerk involuntarisms of certain “golden treasurers.”

For decades now, we have been conned into believing that the young, manic-depressive-and yes, Roman Catholic-Lowell is the only legitimate Lowell. All the other later and debased hypostases are but chips off the one true block, broken field parodies of the original touchdown run whose hundred-yard triumph secured a championship for the team able to count among its retired jerseys such legends of the page as the James Russell of the name and Aunt Amy. Surely it’s time we put away childish things and looked without abashment at Lowell as he is and not just as a sum of parts held in that slipknot version of esteem routinely extended to poets we heartily admire and respect but not by any stretch of the imagination-whether ours or the poet’s-remotely love. One stubbornly destructive myth about Lowell that has been out there for years is his overriding significance as a confessionalist poet-indeed, the doyen of an entire school of confessionalist poets that includes W. D. Snodgrass, John Berryman, Anne Sexton (a student of Lowell’s), and a host of others on whose fame this poet’s own celebrity, via some convoluted whorl of logic, has proved parasitical. And this when all the evidence points to a reversal of roles in his poetry-an unprecedented one, in fact-by which the poet, playing out an inordinately complex psychological drama, is cast not as supplicant but as confessor. In this oddly decentered agon, the Supplicant sins, errs, sinks piteously into a slough of despond and seeks relief from his despair. The Confessor takes note of the Supplicant’s disequilibrium but does not presume to pigeonhole or otherwise categorize his or her lapses. He listens, but does not judge, his task-better yet, his vocation-being to superintend the other’s transgressions from the forest of error to the clearing of grace. Thus, in Lowell’s perennially recyclable transformative world, a poem’s confessionalist “content”-its “dreamwork,” if you will-is assigned the role of Supplicant and its form handed over to the translative overseer of Confessor. If all this seems unduly Catholic, it is, and it isn’t-Catholic, that is. Grace encompasses more than forgiveness, redemption, salvation. It also-pardon the italics-consigns suppleness, agility, lithe spiritual deportment to the sublime limbo of artistic form. Such grace tends to abound precisely where the gnarled issues of form disspiriting content and content de-etherealizing form congregate, which is around the focal point of choosing a metric or form of prosody that will prove serviceable over long stretches of time and verse. How else explain why, in the latter stages of his career, Lowell seized upon the sonnet sequence as the form to sustain an enduring conversation between his own somewhat Yeatsian Self and Soul? True, such sequencing might, to a poet fearful about having passed his prime, have represented the most convenient marital arrangement wherein form and expediency-most notably in the “form” of emotional topicality-might cohabit more or less amicably within not just one poem but an entire run of them, a happenstance we find occurring with marked individuality-and some splendor-in the thematically elaborate sonnet cycle, History.

The most informative key (though not necessarily the best guide) to Lowell’s Collected Poems is, without a doubt, his Collected Prose (1987); and the most useful pieces in that volume are not, as some feel, the two lengthy interviews with Frederick Seidel and the man who would later become his biographer, Ian Hamilton, but the salty and at times morose memoirs commemorating the two most influential weavers of his-one hesitates to say “crazyquilt”-creative carpet: John Crowe Ransom and William Carlos Williams. It is here that we get to see the public and the private Lowell brought together not as Grant met Richmond, but in the manner of that formidable warrior sitting down with his opposite number at Appomattox, with all malice put aside and with only a little resentment for four ill-spent years to lubricate the proceedings. Inhabiting as they do a single hologram (one contracted into a double space able to contain with simultaneity and force the stylistic extremities of “Mr. Edwards and the Spider” [1946] and “91 Revere Street” [1959]), the public and private Lowell are in this pair of pieces (one on each poet) encouraged to come to terms, if only briefly and temporarily, with one another’s alterity and to bespeak the doubts of each other’s univocal mind calmly, and within a contrail of lost time somewhat recaptured through an access of Proustian fortuitousness. (The private agonies of the “public” Lowell were most revealingly displayed during the early years of the Vietnam war when he declined to accept President Lyndon Johnson’s invitation to the White House for a soirée honoring Americans who had distinguished themselves in the arts and was led to participate, along with such literary figures as Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer, in a four-day anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, D.C., in October 1967, culminating in a much publicized attempt to “levitate” the Pentagon. Mailer’s legendarily monomaniacal guide to this event, The Armies of the Night: The Novel as History, History as A Novel [1968], offers a not too flattering glimpse of Lowell’s hesitations and duplicities, but, given the nature of his enterprise, history may have been more novelized than objectively accounted for in this instance.)

The decantings of involuntary memory mentioned above occurred when Lowell felt called upon to write an obituary for the author of Paterson in 1962, and another one, twelve years later, for Ransom in 1974. He had already published two reviews of Williams’s work in 1947 and 1948 and one detailing his views on Ransom in that latter year. His real feelings and the judgments they would result in did not finally cohere, however, until having to deal with the fact of each’s disappearance in the flesh forced Lowell to reconsider how as men and poets they had helped shape American letters and, more importantly perhaps, what his own work had come to say about the posterity their contributions might enjoy in the ricocheting world of achievement bouncing off achievement they had all in their different ways profited from.

Lowell apprenticed himself to Williams and Ransom in different phases of what proved over time a vicious circle of remonstrances. Just about the time that, as a young and impressionable poet, he was pulled toward the “no ideas but in the facts” modality of Williams’s Paterson: Book One (a work that made the New Jersey doctor a contravening heliotrope in more than one natural child’s garden of verses), he found himself being jerked in a direction completely opposed to its tendencies. He and a handful of other gifted ephebes gravitated toward the feet of the scholar poet and critical guru who-you might want to hold your breath here–coined the term “New Criticism” and squired it as a mantra through several decades of almost mystical ascendancy, and could claim over a period of 30 years to have instructed, in addition to Lowell himself, such leading lights of the literary-industrial complex as Allen Tate, Andrew Lytle, Robert Penn Warren, Cleanth Brooks, Randall Jarrell, and Peter Taylor. The experiencing of Ransom was, as Lowell tells it, an epiphany not to be missed, especially as this Southern gentleman’s conversation, which he insists was as well-mannered as the poems he wrote, soared over the unmannerly solecisms of his time like an eagle above a yardful of turkeys.

    . . . How few modern poems-however obscure, fierce, sonorous, pretentious, million-dollar-worded-have the distinction of good conversation. I do not mean mannered conversation, the humor the English are said to inherit or get in their schools; but a distinction that a man must have in him, for he can never fake it or buy it. Literary people as a rule have less of their own to say and consequently use words with less subtlety and precision than a Maine farmer. But this is not what is in question. To appreciate the language of Ransom’s poems, you must realize that it is the language of one of the best talkers that has ever lived in the United States. . . .

But it was to Williams that Lowell would ultimately gravitate, the Williams of the later books of his epic that could somehow never move beyond magnificent torso to fully limbed anthropos in a way that would give living credence to the identification (so important to the poem) of the life of poet with that of his lexicographic alter-ego, Paterson the city, Paterson the river and falls, and Paterson the American Adam. Paterson it was (in belated rediscovery mode) that led Lowell to such experiments as Life Studies and particularly to such experiments in poetic prose as “91 Revere Street.” (With only the slightest twist of historical irony-and addition of a sibilant-that memoir could well have been titled “91 Reverse Street.”) And Paterson it was that saved Lowell from that part of himself that would have continued to serve the muse of formalism in Ransomesque perpetuity, with all its nodes of snobbish conformity and arrogant conservatism masquerading as Euro-cultural conservatorship.

There’s nothing new in proposing that the deckchairs on the well-stuffed liner of Lowell’s career be reshuffled in such a way that, with a nod to Ecclesiastes, the last and least popular of Lowell’s poems shall, when all dust clears, be seen as first and the first last. Nor is trumpeting the desirability of such a realignment likely to keep Lowell’s following-largely untutorable, and probably standing, as I speak, staring at the “You are here” arrow on a diagram of the attractions accessible to tourists in Bidart’s and Gewanter’s (neatly manicured) sacred grove-from insisting things be kept just as they are. The famous remark by Elizabeth Bishop, the poet’s long-time friend, that it is a lot easier to succeed as an American poet with a family name like Lowell to fall back on, drives this point home most “peer-suasively.” But for those unconvinced of the insidious alchemy that mightily conjuring noms de famille can work, a brief parenthesis will no doubt prove instructive. In a tribute to T. S. Eliot published shortly after the great man’s death, Lowell recalled a conversation he’d had with him in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Lowell was but a stripling of twenty-five. “Behind us,” he remembered, “was Harvard Memorial Hall with its wasteful, irreplaceable Victorian architecture and scrolls of Civil War dead. Before us, the rush-hour traffic.” Stuck for a subject of conversation that would bridge their difference in age, Eliot “out of a blue sky” asked: “‘Don’t you loathe being compared with your relatives?'” After a significant pause, during which the younger poet “put the question to myself, groping for what I really felt, for what I should decently feel and what I should indecently feel,” Eliot piped up, “‘I do'” and paused again. After a moment and “with a changed lifting voice of delight,” he declared, “‘I was reading Poe’s reviews the other day. He took up two of my family and wiped the floor with them.'” Another pause, and then: “‘I was delighted.'” Now, before anyone is tempted to dissolve in admiration before Eliot’s repudiation of snobbery in all its cunning abjections, it might be wise to go back to an Eliotic crux as etched in critical marble as it is shrewd in its hypostasizing of critics’ short-sightedness. I am referring to the often cited passage from the 1919 essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” in which poets who court the “personal” are roundly condemned for letting the side down. “Poetry,” Eliot harrumphs in that snooty tone generally reserved for reminding the rabble their place is with Dickens and Billy Bunter but not with him, “is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality.” Then-and one can imagine with what relish Eliot primed the kicker that follows-“But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want escape from these things.” Well, it’s the same with having notables and honorables as relatives. One has to have them before one can privately enjoy seeing them raked over the coals by their inferiors, at least with regard to the social register.

The sting of that Eliotic scorpion’s tail cannot have failed to register socially on Lowell, and well past his twenty-fifth year, the one designated in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” as the watershed time when a poet chooses to either become a compleat angler and fish for life or simply cuts bait and does something else for a living. The trouble is that it is mighty difficult to get a precise fix on just what it is that makes Lowell Lowell. In fact, without a reliable b.s. detector and a divining rod to show where the gushers aren’t, it’s nearly impossible. For there are gushers aplenty in Lowell country, and no mistake. His “land of unlikeness”-that topos in which even things that fail to resemble one another manifest a disturbing resemblance to themselves, and in ways not apparent to the dualistic eye bequeathed modernity by the Cogito of Descartes-is allowed to breed its own rhetoric of excess, its own recombinant DNA of de trop-as Paul Valéry might have put it, had he lived to see French Enlightenment duple consciousness reluctantly give way to the double helix. Indeed, Allen Tate’s Introduction to Lowell’s first hornbook hints at just such a proliferating sameness amid the metastases of difference in this poet’s world. “The style,” he writes, “is bold and powerful, and the symbolic language often has the effect of being willed; for it is an intellectual style compounded of brilliant puns and shifts of tone; and the willed effect is strengthened by the formal stanzas, to which the language is forced to conform.” Willed effects, language being forced into strongholds of accommodation with errancies of logopoeia, scintillant paranomasias and other observancies mentalized beyond their perceptual means: these, from the get-go, were Lowell’s figural stock in trade, his inventory of sight-drafts drawn on exacerbated spirituality’s accounts receivable.

One of the best examples in that first volume so reflective of Lowellian distrust of all but the most phenomenologically disinheritable of everyday reality’s hangers-on is “Christ for Sale.” This is a poem in which statement per se is made to take a back seat to speaking in that peculiarly drawn and quartered version of “tongues” that suggests Pentecostal accountancy adrift in a maze of its own double bookkeeping:

    In Greenwich Village, Christ the Drunkard brews
    Gall, or spilled bone-vat, siphons his bilged blood
    Into weak brain-pans and unseasons wood:
    His auctioneers are four hog-fatted Jews.
    In furs and bundlings of vitality,
    Cur-ladies, ho, swill down the ichor in this Dye.

    Drying upon the crooked nails of time,
    Dirty Saint Francis, where is Jesus’ blood,
    Salvation’s only Fountainhead and Flood?
    These drippings of the Lamb are Heaven’s crime.
    Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, come and buy:
    Gomorrah had you known the wormwood in this Dye!

    Us our Savior’s mangled mouth may kiss
    Although beauticians plaster us with mud:
    Dog of the veins, your nose is stopped with blood;
    Women are thirsty, let them lap on this:
    The lunchers stop to spit into Christ’s eye.
    O Lamb of God, your loitering carrion will die.

The rage engulfing this poem is that of an apostatic Sadducee with tarbucket and Pharisees to burn, but no feathers or a rail to run them out of town with, which in this case is Manhattan and environs. But rage in art is all that it can profitably rise to. The venom, almost too viscous upon the tongue to spew as needed, wastes itself on serpent-tooth generalities of mangled Christs and insufficiently pious Christers. The poet has pulled out most of righteous anger’s stops, and though there be noise enough in this poem to wake the dead, New York’s Avenue “C”-the thoroughfare “bearing Christ’s initial into the New World,” to partially quote the title of a famous poem by Galway Kinnell-is likely to see few resurrections this year of scattered bones and other such fixings of Apocalypse. Also, the organist working the keyboard in this chorale has no easy job keeping these Gadarene syllabics from their date with a cliff. He is left to metricize as well as he can a rhythm from among bellows wheezing for lack of energetic feet to drive them. Clearly (if that’s the right word), the sap of “Christ for Sale” gathers most concentratively in its last four lines, where Lowell’s raffish jeremiad spits into the eye of a Christmas cheer based on lucre and the filth it strews about like Rockefeller dimes thrown to Depressioneers lining Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. Christ’s ravaged body, the soma and ichor of humankind, is revealed as nothing but carrion the single bodily purpose of which is but to die. His sacrifice, spread so thin its rivulets of blood become indistinguishable from beauticians’ mud and cosmeticians’ nail polish, means no more to guzzlers of slop in hundreds of luncheonettes and diners than would a turkey’s to the preparing of a blue plate special.

Fortunately, despair comes equipped with deep pockets, for poems like this dig deep into them. But it’s more for the game of exhausting optimism than to try to stabilize the elevator of hope plummeting out of control. Lowell’s gift-and there’s no doubt whatever that even at his near-worst, we’re dealing with a gifted poet-was for trashing metaphysical environments, life-systems, life-worlds. He had a knack for sensing-it would be ceding too much to call it discovering-just where the tolerable left off and the intolerable began. He could grasp, as in these lines from a poem of his middle period about marriage, “Near the Ocean”-

    Betrayals! Was it the first night?
    They stood against a black and white
    inland New England backdrop. No dogs
    there, horse or hunter, only frogs
    chirring from the dark trees and swamps.
    Elms watching like extinguished lamps.
    Knee-high hedges of black sheep
    Encircling them at every step

-why a slant, bordering on a feminine rhyme had to end the above stanza, why the use of, say, deep, or steep, or leap, for instance, would have thrown the whole shebang of pre–coitum triste recollected in post–tristem tranquility over the edge. Step was as necessary a word choice as any poet short of a Baudelaire could have come up with without risking a case of the bends. Without it, encircling loses all infernal riposte and black sheep its Dantean irony, not to mention the further implication lurking in extinguished lamps of a visionary gleam reduced to the blurred mereness of mimesis en abyme. It’s no accident that “Near the Ocean” followed the glancing improvisations on set themes of Imitations (1961), in which Lowell had the opportunity to try his hand at, among other things, Baudelairean reticence in the face of that sublime tact which only malice can muster in the appropriate seasonal visitations.

His translation-cum-adaptation of “Chant d’automne” shows how well he learned that poet’s lesson of never trying to say more than the deterrences of less permit, the permutations of a poet’s life on the job otherwise making hash of the combinations thrown up by the stress and other occupational hazards of the stressful visionary with attention deficit disorder that randomize everything but the making of verse. Lowell remarks in his Introduction to Imitations that his fourteen Baudelaire poems “were begun as exercises in couplets and quatrains and to get away from the longer, less concentrated problems of translating Racine’s Phèdre.” They may have begun that way, but that is not at all where, or how, they end up. No Anglo-American poet has proved better at catching the iron wisps of Baudelairean tonality than Lowell, unless it be Roy Campbell or-this might shock some readers-Aldous Huxley, who, late in life, perhaps while scouring the tropics for Wordsworth, managed to find voyagers to Cythera able to instruct him how to summon Symbolist shades using nothing more Odyssean than the oxblood dye found in some tourist’s sandals. Translation is all about capturing the will o’ the wisp of tone, which is why, the same Introduction tells us, it was necessary in “laboring hard to get the tone” to be “reckless with literal meaning.” Campbell could get past the shock factor in Baudelaire to the circuitry deep in its innards and convey its amperage to those made eager by convention to take it for the static electricity it isn’t. Take his own version of “Song of Autumn,” for example, which employs the lacy and the gargoylesque to equal disadvantage in dispelling the influence of Poe doing an imitation of Dante:

    Soon into frozen shades, like leaves, we’ll tumble.
    Adieu, short summer’s blaze, that shone to mock.
    I hear already the funereal rumble
    Of logs, as on the paving-stones they shock.

    Winter will enter in my soul to dwell-
    Rage, hate, fear, horror, labor forced and dire!
    My heart will seem, to sun that polar hell,
    A dim, red frozen block, devoid of fire.

    Shuddering I hear the heavy thud of fuel.
    The building of a gallows sounds so good!
    My spirit, like a tower, reels to the cruel
    Battering-ram in every crash of wood.

    The ceaseless echoes rock me and appal.
    They’re nailing up the coffin, I’ll be bound,
    For whom?-Last night was Summer. Here’s the Fall.
    There booms a farewell volley in the sound.

The “tone” Lowell always claimed to be listening for when translating other poets’ exacerbations (for it was these he was primarily drawn to) clings most stubbornly to lines like “The building of a gallows sounds so good!” (“L’échafaud qu’on bâtit n’a pas d’écho plus sourd”) and “The ceaseless echoes rock me and appal” (“Il me semble, bercé par ce choc monotone”). Perhaps Campbell goes out too far on a limb with the first of these lines which is almost bound to bring bounding to the contemporary reader’s mind Robert Duvall’s Parthian shot from his helicopter in the movie Apocalypse Now: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning!” But how else render in English, a language which, unlike French, is more susceptible to the “ho” factor than the “hum” and inclines its writers to over-insure themselves against understatement in things like apostrophes and exclamations? The French see their Enlightenment as having been more literary than scientific, while the English have tended since Roger Bacon’s time-and if not quite that far back, then certainly since that of his descendant, Sir Francis-have kept theirs pretty much restricted to the laboratory. This has led French poets to underwrite, not overwrite promptings sent them by their Muse. Thus, Racine-Lowell’s model of leonine grace energized by, as he puts it, “the glory of its hard, electric rage”-could harness a relatively miniscule vocabulary to a life-world of concepts that makes such Shakespearean incandescences as “the multitudinous seas incarnadine” seem less a Roman candle than an over-ambitious sparkler. Racine could not be reckless in his pursuit of iron necessities, but he could pit the headlong improprieties of his heroes and heroines against the tungsten decorums appertaining to every abstract noun filling out that diction of his. Similarly, Baudelaire, though tied down by self-imposed proscriptions like Gulliver at the mercy of the Lilliputians, was able to contain within spaces bounded by rhymes a world in which anything went because the psychic hotel that was his private hell allowed for checking in, but not for checking out. Yet, for all the sexual maladroitness blown up into, among other things, occult aggrandisements of prowess and juicily racist stereotypes (giant negresses presiding over bondage fantasies, etc.), the ceremonies that Baudelaire made himself master of seem grotesquely public for a poet who, despite a taste for les plaisirs du boulevardier, preferred for the most part to eat in. Translative geniuses like Campbell and Lowell show us where the true Baudelairean recklessness-that without which art falls back to paint-by-number avant gardism-resides, and it isn’t in the metrics, where the floral arranger of evil blooms is about as radical as Hugo or Lamartine.

Lowell found such recklessness no less obligatory when writing his own verse. In his poetic universe, literal meaning, the photographic measure of a poem’s reality, itself measurable in pixels, declines in importance as the field of vision expands to meet the shutter speed of tone moving in perpendicular or inverse relation to it. Strict form can prevent the two axes of realization from butting heads, but only if the requisite “technique, luck and rightness of hand” guide the enterprise. This supports the notion already suggested by some critics that because Lowell drew no effective distinctions between his translations and his original verse, we shouldn’t either; that in fact we could glean as much of Lowell’s poetic method from an adaptation like “Autumn” as from anything in volumes like Life Studies and The Dolphin (1973). How, for instance, distentions of personality can be folded into the concavities liverish distemper would ordinarily cede to melodramatic foie gras:

    Now colder shadows . . . Who’ll turn back the clock?
    Goodbye bright summer’s brief too lively sport!
    The squirrel drops its acorn with a shock,
    cord-wood reverberates in my cobbled court.

    Winter has entered in my citadel:
    hate, anger, fear, forced work like splitting rock,
    and like the sun borne to its northern hell,
    my heart’s no more than a red, frozen block.

    Shaking, I listen for the wood to fall;
    building a scaffold makes no deafer sound.
    Each heart-beat knocks my body to the ground,
    like a slow battering ram crumbling a wall.

    I think this is the season’s funeral,
    some one is nailing a coffin hurriedly.
    For whom? Yesterday summer, today fall-
    The steady progress sounds like a goodbye.

In a successful translation, Lowell’s view suggests, the resemblance horizon between the poem rendered into the poet’s own language and a typically fine poem of his or her own should be virtually seamless, and when highly successful, entirely seemless as well. This is not to say that two notably distinct and individual poets are made by an act of transliterative homogenization to fade into one, but rather that the virtues-and yes, even the faults-of the original meld into a single stylistic potential of which the translator poet is the principal manipulator, if not designer. The chief difference between “Autumn” and “Chant d’automne” is that, beyond mere accidents of language and ethos, there is neither a chief difference nor a need to establish one. In which defining particulars could, for example, Lowell’s own “Snake,” from the twelve-sonnet sequence “New York” that is part of For Lizzie and Harriet (1973), be said to differ from the Baudelairean sixteener cited above? Certainly not in its habiliments of psychic ravage and religious hyperventilation:

    One of God’s creatures, just as much as you,
    or God; what other bends its back in crooks
    and curves so gracefully, to yield a point;
    brews a more scalding venom from cold blood;
    or flings a spine-string noosed about their throats:
    hysterical bird, wild pig, or screaming rabbit?
    Often I see it sunning on bright, brisk days,
    when the heat has ebbed from its beloved rocks;
    it is seamless, scaled down to its integrity,
    coiled for indiscriminate malevolence.
    Lately, its valor pushed it past men’s patience;
    stoned, raw-fleshed, it finds its hold-sentenced
    to hibernate fifty years. . . . It will thaw, then kill-
    my little whip of wisdom, lamb in wolf-skin.

Both are-to whatever muzzy (and fuzzy) extent the formula is accepted as currency- “Lowell poems,” our inability to hone that distinction any finer being less the fault of our critical faculties than of the distance such distinctions will travel on a chit of frequent flier miles depreciated by our having shuttled thoughtlessly and for too long between both Aristotelian and postmodern hubs. Without wasting too much time separating the nominalist goo of one from the anti-realist gloop of the other, let’s just say that the Aristotelian mindset grounds the formula’s proprietary fungibility in moribund properties of style, while the postmodern reëstablishes the authority of the formula by not so subtly opting for the absence-is-really-presence dodge beloved of neo-Sartrean anexistentialists like Jacques Derrida and the late Paul de Man. In any case, neither version of the formula can really provide a satisfactory account of why, despite an obvious lack of rhyme and stanzaic development, “Autumn” and “Snake” share a familial resemblance that exceeds mere propinquities of style and renders “Baudelairean” less an art-historical fact than a modality infinitely adaptable to recombinant poetic occasions well beyond those determined by “influence” or Bloomian “strong poet” assimilations.

The conveying of another poet’s essence through the appropriation of his or her tone so that in the process of translation the various peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of the subject are overwritten by the style of the poet rendering them-and all this with inappreciable damage to that essence being apparent-is something of a Lowell invention. English-speaking poets from Dryden to Pound have made brave forays into the hinterlands of “imitation” and have exhibited interesting if not always useful specimens from their exploratory travels. Fabular creatures along the lines of Pope’s Homer or Johnson’s Londonizing of Juvenal in late Augustan satires such as “The Vanity of Human Wishes” are triumphs of misunderstanding tout court, but we are still lucky to have them, just as we are to have Pound’s renderings of Li Po, Propertius, Arnaut Daniel, Guido Cavalcanti and in prose, Enrico Pea.

Yet, we know, too, the cost of tampering with literalness, whatever the collateral benefits of doing so might be. The loss of Vermeerian verisimilitude, with its cathedral tune of art in excelsis assuming mortal heft from the loftiness of its own organicism, is always in its way a kind of tragedy possessing a unique pathos and fibrillation of hubris. Though in a translation like Pound’s “The River Merchant’s Wife: A Letter” we can glory in the freshness of a foreign ethos splendidly recaptured, the coup of double bookkeeping by which all such restorative feats are brought off is not to be dismissed lightly. Modernist dogma has trained us to scoff at the naturalism of a Li Po laughably denatured by a Witter Bynner or an Arthur Waley. It has been drummed into us that Pound, via the transparencies of Ernest Fenollosa’s scholarly reconstructions from the Japanese, got Li Po right. This, if we apply the Tetragrammaton sacred to the New Critics, signifies that Pound not only righted the drunken boat of yet another forsaken classic, but he managed to reground an ancient Chinese lyric in a world congruent with its own, while making it wholly accessible to any sophisticated twentieth-century Westerner. It’s odd that Pound should have been so contemptuous of the operatic composer Puccini-referring to him more than once as Spuccini-since so many of the author of Mauberley‘s homages to long dead poets took the form of arias accompanied by their own strange verbal music. With his superb renderings of the Confucian canon and traditional anthology of Chinese poetry, he did much to counter the distortions, then everywhere rampant, of generic Chinoiserie-on-the-hoof, much as the Italian composer of Madama Butterfly raised the tone of Japonnaiserie inundating Europe and America at the end of the nineteenth century.

In short, Lowell did more to render the distinction between an “original” piece of verse and a translation moot than virtually any other English-speaking poet since Ezra Pound. And that without his having produced a large corpus of “non-adaptive” translations, of which his Phèdre probably remains the most notable in conventional terms. Drawing the relational string between Lowell and Pound (two poets with very different careers but whose lives, rendered bipolar by insanity crossgrained with religious and political radicalism, coincided in odd ways) into a more restrictive loop: the singular incursion of Lowell into the Racinian world of tragedy occupies a place in his canon which is roughly comparable to that of the Sophoclean dustoffs, Elektra (1950) and Women of Trachis (1956), in the poetic output of Pound. What propelled him from poetic project to poetic project was often less a desire to hone or acquire a new technical skill than a need to take a busman’s holiday, prosodically speaking, and to move on to a form of composition that involved a poetic challenge very different from what he was used to. Lowell’s sense of originality was not one restricted by any Romantic notion of seerdom or of visionary afflatus assignable to some special status conferred upon “the Poet.” Being a poet (with a small “p”) put him in touch, as he admitted in an interview with Frederick Seidel (appearing, as mentioned earlier, in the Collected Prose volume), with “a kind of wildness and power that appeals to me.” But it is a wildness and power that emanate from within rather than from without; from the reservoirs of anguish and joy that build up over time as a consequence of the poet’s own thrashings about in life, not from any unique dispensation tapped into as though it were an artesian well.

Where Lowell’s consuming passion for translation came from is even now anything but clear since the poets who most influenced him and to whom he was closest did not share the same interest in burrowing into the language worlds of foreign writers from the inside out. His professional soul-mate Randall Jarrell dabbled in translation, but in a distracted way rather than a devoted one, such labors undertaken largely, it now appears in retrospect, to keep him from dwelling on the awful reviews his verse was getting in most of the ranking poetry journals. His mostly lamentable mockup of Faust, Part One has more flying around in it responsible for Eckermann-like chirps than for any eagle cries we might be tempted to attribute to Goethe. Nor is there much to point to amid all the wan formulaics and reduction of echt Deutsch abstractions à la Herder and von Holmboldt to “Berlitz-krieg” German that would identify the empathetic lover of language who wrote the magnificent essays that make up Poetry and the Age (1953). Though Lowell’s translative eye roved farther and with more wanderlust than most of his contemporaries (even his rival in the recasting of Phèdre, Richard Wilbur, did not attempt to crack the nuts of anything like the number of styles essayed by the author of Imitations), it was always with the intent of learning some metrical trick or sleight-of-tongue that would push his own stylistic envelope into the realm of the untried. However, a complaint frequently voiced about envelopes being pushed in this way was that the territory thrust into smacked more of the unkempt than of the unknown.

The best of Lowell’s efforts at aligning French, German, Italian and Russian systoles with non-fibrillating English diastoles are probably to be found in his renderings of Boris Pasternak, the much controverted Soviet writer whose novel (with poetic addendum), Doctor Zhivago (1957), earned him a Nobel Prize for Literature which East-West politics of the early ‘60s prevented him from accepting in Stockholm. His adaptations of “September,” “For Anna Akhmatova,” “Mephistopheles,” “The Seasons,” “Sparrow Hills,” “Wild Vines,” the somewhat Frostian “In the Woods,” “The Landlord” and, perhaps most famously, “Hamlet in Russia, A Soliloquy,” bespeak a freedom and a consideration for the protocols of not just alterity but radical foreignness-Lowell admitted to knowing not a single word of Russian-which make them unique specimens of their kind. They are truly remarkable instances of two singular sensibilities having intuitively interpenetrated one another without benefit of any personal contact whatever. Who, without prior knowledge of the circumstances, would have dared to suggest that the following eight lines are, effectively speaking, the translation of a translation?

    The clapping stops. I walk into the lights
    as Hamlet, lounge like a student against the door frame,
    and try to catch the far-off dissonance of life-
    all that has happened, and must!

From the dark the audience leans its one hammering brow against me-
ten-thousand opera glasses, each set on the tripod!
Abba, Father, all things are possible with thee-
take away this cup! . . .

Pasternak’s gift was to kick against the pricks without the pricks cottoning to what was going on. It worked for a while and then the inevitable happened: the pricks caught up with what had been kicking against them and substantially raised the ante of retribution. The composer Dmitri Shostakovich and the eventually exiled poet Joseph Brodsky experienced the same reversal of fortune when their attitudinal melodies could no longer sustain the kind of anonymity the Soviet authorities demanded mask an artistic indifference to politics that was real, inclusive and maximally sustainable. Lowell could translate him along with Villon, Baudelaire, Leopardi, Rilke, Montale, and others like them because he felt kinship with poets for whom coercive constraints imposed from without matched those exerted from within. Each and every poet he “imitated” was not only forced to endure a version of Kafkan internal exile within the body of a Landsmann for whom only two alternatives were possible: mindless good standing or Room 101 in Orwell’s 1984. But he also had to cope with unusually severe psychological pressures stemming from an inability to conform to even the least complicated exigencies of life. Lowell’s model of the poet was that of the creative misfit to airy thinness beat by relational angst compounded with his own uniquely secreted sickness unto death. He remained fascinated by the translational process in the same way a Reichian patient cannot stop thinking about his or her analysis. It comes poetically to stand for all the minutiae of everyday metamorphosis whereby the quotidian, benignly diffuse in itself, becomes transmuted into character armor the rigidity of which makes the further diffusion of benignity impossible. When, as in the case of Pasternak’s “Wild Vines,” one translates from another’s berth in the harbor of wish fulfillment-

    Beneath a willow entwined with ivy,
    we look for shelter from the bad weather;
    one raincoat covers both our shoulders-
    my fingers rustle like the wild vines around your breasts.

    I am wrong. The rain’s stopped.
    Not ivy but the hair of Dionysus
    hangs from these willows. What am I to do?
    Throw the raincoat under us!

-it effectively sets in motion a rebirthing process able to transform a purgatorial slum into a vicarious paradise. By contrast, how limp and unalive is the translation (titled “Hopbines”) by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, appended to the English edition of Doctor Zhivago (1958), done by Max Hayward and Manya Harari:

    We seek shelter from inclement weather
    Under a willow entwined with ivy.
    A raincape is thrown over our shoulders.
    My arms are tightly encircled about you.

    Sorry-I erred. The shrubs in these thickets
    Are not ivy-grown but covered with hopbines.
    Well, we’ll do better if we take this raincape
    And spread it out wide for a rug beneath us.

Comparing the two versions yields a paucity of samenesses testifying to Lowell’s greater freedom born of enticement by and rapture over the original. There’s nothing in the Pasternak about the rain stopping; that’s Lowell’s invention, just as his discovery of “the hair of Dionysus” squares a rhetorical circle drawn by the insistent substitution of fingers rustling “like the wild vines around your breasts” for arms that do much less explicit sexual work in Guerney’s traversal.

Much space has been devoted in this review to Lowell as translator because I believe that is how he most wished to be perceived. In an equivalent sense, all his original poems may be viewed as “translations” and all his translations as “originals”; the scare quotes assign whatever differences there are between these categories to the circular file, where they likely belong. If it seems outlandish and even a violation of reputation to view poems like “After the Surprising Conversions” as a “translation,” then perhaps some of the controversy can be drained from such an assignation if a distinction is drawn between the conventional (read: Browningesque) “dramatic monologue” and how Lowell went about transforming a missive composed by the 18th Century American divine, Jonathan Edwards, into a circular letter proposing a pyramid scheme involving the sophistic circuitries of faith. Lowell, it could be said, treats the Edwards letter as though it were the record of worker bees attending the Queen of the religious sciences, reaping theological hope as She sows existential doubt. The translation is in the paraphrasing of mere historical Edwards into the argot of unannealed Reality-

    September twenty-second, Sir, the bough
    Cracks with the unpicked apples, and at dawn
    The small-mouthed bass breaks water, gorged with spawn.

Lowell wrote as though he were simultaneously inscribing an Ur-text along with the “original” poem meant to pass as its translation. That is possibly why so many of the early poems seem knotty with a pregnancy upon which they are powerless to deliver more than broken water and a simulacrum of labor pains. To compose both the Ur-text and its transliteration at once is to tempt more than just the fates of decomposition. It is to deliver oneself up to their Narn-like spinsterhoods-in-despair over flaws in Moira’s weave thrown out of court by Ananke, to which even the gods are subject.

It was probably best that Lowell died when he did, missing the second great postmodern heave, for he was a maximalist in an age of rank minimalisms. That’s right: minimalisms-plural; there were in fact many of them, different more in degree than kind, and all more or less indebted to and clones of Warholian arrogance and anaestheticism. The modernists-all but a few recidivists like Ezra Pound-might have declared a version of war on Beauty, but postmodernism arrayed itself against all the traditional rationales of art: vigor, metamorphosis, grandeur of purpose, if not of effect. Art is Giotto and El Greco, it’s Spenser and Watteau and Mozart. It’s also T. S. Eliot and Marcel Proust and Andrew Wyeth. “Art” is Laurence Sterne (yes, I’m with Dr. Johnson on Tristram Shandy), much of the “classic” Picasso, John Cage, Morton Feldman, David Hockney, and John Barth. The vast preponderance of so-called “postmodernism”-all its exponents and apologists to the contrary notwithstanding-is but lower-case hell projected in two dimensions on a scrim hung between scare quotes. Do we really need to add that Robert Lowell would have none of this? Very early on, Lowell, along with that neurotic band of autoecious angels with whom he danced that dance out of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal-John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Delmore Schwartz, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Sexton, and others similarly taxed by the bottle and its imps-simply fell out of step with an America baited with idealism but hooked quite helplessly on loneliness and self-abuse. Where they were truly out in left field was in their unshakeable awareness that, in the wake of the Depression and a war that had cleansed the world of fascism, something out there was not right, and it made a whole lot of things in here not right, either. Some door of perception, they felt, tempted the visionary out of hiding when open a crack, but proved mortally wounding, or even fatal, when fully ajar. By the mid-‘60s, Lowell and his contemporaries were feeling old, marginalized, and out of step even with being out of step. The young, in defiance of Lowell’s generation’s experience with recreational drugs and sex were busily concocting their own much more ill-mannered and shabbily dressed train wreck. The in here was no longer “in here,” it was out there. Lionel Trilling, staring out his Columbia University office window at students rioting in Upper Manhattan was heard to comment that modernism was now in the streets. Rimbaud had found new barricades upon which to commune unintelligibly with dérèglement; his own youthful countrymen and women would have their own brief moment in the sun in May 1968. Lowell might have sympathized with their dynamism and hysterical élan, but he must have found himself wondering how Bergson’s vital had wandered so sheep-like into such deep doo-doo.

Bidart’s and Gewanter’s edition of the Collected Poems fails to justify the long wait to have this poet whole and unselected, but they’re surely to be commended for their patience, if not for ours. The book has heft, it has weight and it has substance. What it doesn’t have-though it toggles celebrity appeal as a hot item should, from the coy portrait of the poet on the dust jacket to the sometimes odd spacing of poems on the page-is greatness. Lowell was dealt a hand that from several points of view was, despite his many gifts, not a first-rate one. What he made of that hand, against long odds, rewrote Hamlet’s assessment of the genius-to-madness continuum in runes etched with manic depression and personal horror. Mercifully, the poems for the most part skirt the hems of that elaborately unraveling fabric and take up the burden of a quite different mortality, though one not a whit less truthful or exacerbated than the one passed over. Though considered by many a confessional poet, Lowell wrote through his agonies, not about them. He had in abundance what Keats called “negative capability”; he could substitute frame state for frame state, leaving himself and his experience not so much out of the equation as the determiner of its exponency. Hence, “Square in Black,” from Day by Day (1977), is about a photograph taken of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad in 1861, but it is also a rumination, with black borders, of his own redoubled descent into the father-son maelstrom-first as the son of his own father, and much later, as the father of Robert Sheridan Lowell, born in 1971. “Fortunately,” he muses in the last stanza, “I only dream inconsequence.” The difference between talented poets and ourselves is that they dream inconsequence because they are every day realizing Dasein, whereas we dream Dasein because every day inconsequence realizes us.

The much touted apparatus of the edition suggests a poet much longer dead than Lowell, and in more ways than one. A different drummer may be heard marching in these thousand-plus pages of poetry. His uniquely American tune will haunt us as long as poetry is tolerated beyond the hootenanny of Volkischkeit and Creative Writing conferences. I can imagine Lowell, if he were alive now, holding this monumental door-stop in his hands and wondering where he’d best begin trying to translate the best, somehow unrealized poems out of wrenchable Yankee into echt American.

Ever the sublime imperfectionist, he’d probably start with all those anthology pieces that have made him such a legend of incoherence in our own time. And like Pasternak’s Zhivago, be Hamlet all over again.


### The Refining Instrument of Poetry: James Rother Interviews Sherod Santos
Posted on 30 March 2001

Interviewer’s Note: Poet and essayist Sherod Santos is the author of four books of poetry, Accidental Weather (Doubleday, 1982), The Southern Reaches (Wesleyan, 1989), The City of Women (W. W. Norton, 1993), and, most recently, The Pilot Star Elegies (W. W. Norton, 1999), which was both a National Book Award Finalist and one of five nominees for The New Yorker Book Award. Mr. Santos’ poems appear regularly in such journals as The New Yorker, The Paris Review, The Nation, Poetry, and The Yale Review. His essays have appeared in American Poetry Review, The New York Times Book Review, The Kenyon Review and Parnassus, and a collection of those essays, A Poetry of Two Minds, has just been released (University of Georgia Press, 2000). His awards include the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award, the Discovery/The Nation Award, the Oscar Blumenthal Prize from Poetry, a Pushcart Prize in both poetry and the essay, and the 1984 appointment as Robert Frost Poet at the Frost house in Franconia, New Hampshire. He has received fellowships from the Ingram Merrill and Guggenheim foundations, and the National Endowment for the Arts. From 1990-1997, Mr. Santos served as external examiner and poet-in-residence at the Poets’ House in Portmuck, Northern Ireland, and in 1999 he received an Award for Literary Excellence from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is currently professor of English at the University of Missouri – Columbia.

Q: The way books of poetry acquire their titles is often curious and fascinating. What led you to choose The Pilot Star Elegies as its title?

A: In the navigational world there are such things called pilot stars, those stars in the firmament which, at any given time of year, one might fix on to establish one’s location on the earth. This interested me both for literal and metaphorical reasons, and of course I felt those reasons served, however obliquely, the tonal structure of the collection overall.

Q: Do you feel that The Pilot Star Elegies represents a departure from your three earlier books of poetry, Accidental Weather, The Southern Reaches, and The City of Women?

A: I think there is something of a departure in both The City of Women and The Pilot Star Elegies, though that has less to do with any purposeful design on my part, at least as I began writing those books, than it does with the varying demands of the books themselves. The first is concerned with erotic and romantic love, the second with death, so it seems natural that they’d acquire somewhat different ways of speaking.

Q: In this latest collection you seem less preoccupied with objects and situations shimmering in suspended time, as in (to cite the term you use in “Abandoned Railway Station”) a boule-de-neige, than with a more worldly engagement with people and places thrown together in a time-sharing of exile and loss?

A: What you describe by way of the boule de neige is, essentially, the lyric poem, and it’s fair to say that in these last two books I have worked within a much larger temporal framework. Still, my ambition was always to approach that framework through the moment of the lyric, by arranging those moments, somewhat in the manner of a stained glass window, into a composition that’s not contained in any of those moments individually. This provides, I hope, the illusion both of time past and of time in the process of passing, just as sunlight through a stained glass window provides the illusion of wholeness and coherence.

Q: We asked you earlier about the relationship of The Pilot Star Elegies to your earlier collections. How do you feel your work has grown over the four volumes? Have particular themes and concerns tended to emerge, without your immanent knowledge or consent, as dominant shapers of the way you write poetry?

A: As for the first part of your question, I couldn’t really say. As for the second part, I can say yes, absolutely. You see, I still harbor the rather quaint idea that poems have things to teach me, and one of the things they have to teach is how to write a poem. Because of that, I tend to try, as much as possible, to let the poem have the reins. Of course, there are unavoidable tics and mannerisms in any poet, but I’m less interested in refining those characteristics into some fixed idea of a style than I am in finding out what elements of style will best draw out the inner workings of my subject.

Q: Many of your poems have a deceptively prosaic character: they are built with lines 12-14 syllables long, they have slant rhymes, and prose responsibilities. How did you come to this style? (Is this, in other words, a response to the Whitmanic tradition of long lines, an Englishing of the French alexandrine, or an attempt to break the English pentameter by extending it a foot or two?)

A: You’re speaking of course about the last two books, and again the subject of those poems dictated the forms in which they were written. In “Elegy for My Sister”, for example, I was struggling with a very complicated set of issues, not the least of which was: To what extent is my writing about my sister’s suicide an appropriation of her suffering for my art? At the simplest level, who was this elegy really for? My sister or me? And what did I hope to gain by writing it? To eulogize her? To console myself and our family? To bring some sort of closure to her life, her death? To create a more socially acceptable portrait of her for posterity’s sake? As you might imagine, I was horrified by those possibilities. And so, to answer your question, circumstances demanded, or seemed to demand, the least possible artfulness or flourish in the writing, a subordination of all those things that draw one’s attention back to the writer. I wanted a certain transparency in the writing. I wanted a reader to look past, or through, the words themselves. At the same time I wanted them to be significant, to be mediated through the refining instrument of poetry, for words are, after all, our only real connection to the dead.

Q: A number of your poems, it seems to me, appear to lend themselves to musical settings of the sort the art song composer Ned Rorem does so well. The first numbered lyric in “Elegy for My Sister” stands out particularly in this regard. Are you aware of some of your poems veering off, despite their deceptively prosaic prosody, and resembling a species of meditative lieder, as it were, in which variations on themes are conceived as much musically as poetically?

A: I’m not knowledgeable enough about musical settings to answer this question very thoroughly, though I do feel a certain kinship with the notion of a meditative lieder, as both a form and a process of composition. One of the things that I admire in Ned Rorem’s compositions is the scale to which they adapt themselves, their refusal of what he calls–if I’m remembering correctly–”the masterpiece syndrome.” And here, too, it seems to me that we’re back in the terrain of the lyric, and, as such, I’m not sure I make the same distinction you do at the end of your question. To conceive a poem poetically” means, to my mind, to conceive of it “musically.”

Q: While no precise count was kept of the times the theme and/or motif of “backlighting” is alluded to in your latest volume, its recurrence would suggest that things perceived as “backlit” figure rather prominently in your lexicon of images. Does this have particular meaning for you, or is it something that has more coincidental than real significance in your work?

A: This hadn’t occurred to me, though of course that doesn’t mean it’s either coincidental or insignificant. I suppose memory is, by nature, “backlit”–at least insomuch as it poses what’s recollected in the soft- or hard-edged light of the past–and because it’s elegiac, the poetry of memory is going to have something of that backlit character.

Q: What are your views on creative writing programs, and their influence on contemporary poetry? Of late, as you are probably aware, critics have begun to blame these programs for (what they see as) a loss of individuality in American verse.

A: A loss of individuality in American verse? Who are they kidding? Has there ever been a more individuated poetry in the history of the world? To think that our poetry can somehow be characterized, for better or worse, by reference to “creative writing programs” is either culturally naïve or intellectually irresponsible. From the Black Aesthetics of Askia Muhammad Touré to the Steinian poetics of Charles Bernstein, from the engagé of Adrienne Rich to the dégagé of John Ashbery, from the canonical authority of the Harpers Anthology of 20th Century Native American Poetry to the defensive neo-classicism of the New Formalists, from Miguel Algarin’s Voices from the Nuyorican Poets’ Café to the Cowboy traditions of Howard “Jack” Thorp and Bruce Kiskaddon, from the hip-hop rhythms of rap to the haphazard rhythms of the poetry slam….It may be more accurate to call it, not “contemporary American poetry” at all, but “contemporary American poetries.” I’m of course familiar with the kinds of complaints you mention–I’ve responded to them at length in A Poetry of Two Minds, in an essay entitled “In a Glass Darkly, Darkly”–but perhaps you can tell me why it is such unsupported claims are granted such automatic credence. You say, “Of late…critics have begun,” but the truth is that these complaints have been around for years, and regardless of how scrupulously and thoughtfully and variously they’ve been addressed, you can rest assured that in a very short while they’ll surface again, exactly as before, delivered to a welcoming audience with the wide-eyed fervor of some journalist uncovering a senatorial tryst. Why is that, do you suppose?

Q: Can serious poetry regain the common readers it once had?

A: Yes, of course it can, and it has, and anyone who hasn’t noticed that is just not paying attention. Not only has the mainstream begun to open its doors to a widening range of marginalized poets, but the last two decades have seen an unprecedented burst of poetry activities, from White House celebrations hosted by the President and First Lady to the formation of a national poetry month; from billboards in Los Angeles filled with poems by contemporary poets to the inclusion of a poetry book as a standard feature with all new Volkswagens shipped in April; from cross-country book giveaways inspired by Joseph Brodsky’s claim that poetry should be as available as the Gideon Bible to the distribution by tollbooth operators in New Jersey of free copies of Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass”. Added to that we’ve seen a huge proliferation of poetry awards, web sites, spoken arts recordings, open mike nights, and public radio and television specials. All this couldn’t have happened without the interest and enthusiasm of the common reader.

Q: What advice would you offer to the young poet? What would you have him do or read for his poetic education?

A: Oh, I don’t know. Read everything, avoid thinking you’re a genius, don’t settle too early on for what kind of poetry you want to write, and be willing and able to give up everything for the work without expecting anything whatsoever in return.

### The Problems of Prosody

Why Quality Control in Poetry Need Not Be Blindsided by Traditionalism

As Reviewed By: James Rother

For decades now, responsible elements within the critical community have disagreed over how to save American poetry from itself. The matter vs. antimatter struggle pitting “strong measures” Parnassians against anything-goes free versers has lost little of its rancor after more than a half-century’s wrangling. Hardly anyone remembers when the battle-not-so-royal between Tweeds and Sandals first broke out, it was so long ago. Even through the “who gives a damn” ‘70s, poor relations between the two schools were the rule, and this persisted past the formalist revival of the ‘80s up to the attempt made by the present journal seven years ago to retrieve the ball dropped by Hilton Kramer’s The New Criterion and become The Newer Criterion. (Our intention was to make better, if not good, on the mandate of the original Criterion—T. S. Eliot’s, out of London—to counter barbarism and anarchy in the arts in the years of entre deux guerres). The great modernists caught in Pound’s magnetic field, though keen to sponsor upheavals in structure, remained staunchly loyal to the cult of form. Cultists of The Waste Land and The Cantos should never forget that at the conclusion of World War I, both Eliot and Pound restricted their output to satires composed in rhyming quatrains, and they did that to reverse the “open form” revolution they themselves had helped launch in 1912 under the brand name “Imagism.”

Is there a responsible alternative to the tight-assed approach, or is the “solution” arrived at by the pointy-headed nerds manning L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry’s Yahoo servers really all that’s out there? If the only remaining (note the avoidance of the word “viable”) option open to poets today are the algorithm and the music box morphing “new” Mozart tunes out of old, the time has come to cut off their credit cards and insist they find marketable skills to keep the enterprise going.[private]

Some might of course argue that a number of poets have already found such skills and are profiting handsomely by hawking them to the corporate world, especially the electronic media. They are even nesting comfortably in the moral-neutral world of advertising. Poetry, they will tell you (having been weaned on the dot.com revolution of the ‘90s) is no longer pre-eminently verbal, if it ever was so. To the contrary, it is most at home where immediacy and mindfulness converge, which is to say in the realm of pure motion, and motion is, not all that coincidentally, what the only tenuously verbal electronic media do best.

Does it have to be this way? Does poetry really have to choose between an Elba that is wholly untenable and a St. Helena from which only poisoners and gravediggers ever return? I don’t believe that it does, and I have a remedy for the ills afflicting contemporary poetry, though slammers and “summer school of the arts” types will likely pronounce it unworkable in equal numbers. Quite simply, it is this: Someone should declare the formalism-informalism war unwinnable and we should move on. To what? To a status quo ante suggested by Peter Viereck in “Anti-form or Neo: A Curse on Both Houses” as a starting point for restoring order and sanity to the affairs of contemporary poetry. Viereck’s essay appeared in Parnassus in 1993, so on the basis of simple math, we’re already twelve years behind schedule in getting things back on track.

Viereck begins with a defense of poetry’s traditional anchors, which is to say rhyme, metrical pulse, and the whole organicist arsenal of justifications for the ways poetry from its very beginnings has accommodated itself to the needs and expressive instruments of the human cardio-vascular system. “Imagine that you are drowning,” he begins by saying.

The water surrounds you, it enters your lungs. Your breath chokes, you are drawn downwards. Suddenly, an arm comes behind you and holds you up, and you are pulled slowly to shore. There on the beach, a lifeguard revives your heart and lungs, breathing into your mouth once for every five heart massages, as he or she was taught. Five to one. Ta-TUM. Ta-TUM, ta-TUM, ta-TUM, ta-TUM.

Your life has just been saved by iambic pentameter. Would you trust your life to a free-verse lifeguard? Our life, like our poetry, depends on this body rhythm, a rhythm denounced as outworn by Pound. Yet it outwears—how Shakespearean of nature!—its outwearers. During one of my campus poetry reading tours, a heckler interrupted me by exclaiming, “The iambs’s not a normal way of speech.” I invited him to scan his protest.

Neat, witty, and certainly pertinent from a life-saving angle. But it was over-familiar even before it sank to a cliché. And that applies also to its Siamese twin, the notion that the length of the human breath rather than the beating of the heart is the key factor in returning poetry to not just a human but a visceral theater of operations. The two views essentially comprise a single argument, certain superficial differences to the contrary not withstanding. Stanley Burnshaw’s The Seamless Web remains one of the best apologias ever provided this vita-suet, but it no more decides the case whether we should consider what makes poetry tick of a piece with what human clockwork needs to keep ticking than do Sidney’s and Shelley’s Platonically defensive brocades.

Actually, the “heartbeats and pulsebeats” rationale, as Viereck himself is quick to remind us, has its roots in Aristotle and Galen. “Poems,” he writes, “scan naturally on alternate beats, not every which way, because such is our flesh: We walk, march, or dance on exactly two feet, two alternating feet, not every which way on amoeba pseudopods.” He then proceeds to cite the martyred Russian poet Osip Mandelstam, who in his “Conversation about Dante” opined that “the metrical foot is the inhalation and exhalation of the step. . . . The step, linked with breathing and saturated with thought, Dante understood as the beginning of prosody.” Yet, is not the end of prosody the facilitation of those means by which the beginning of a line of poetry arrives at its own end with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of energy transfer from alpha-wave state to verbal consciousness in the mind of the poet? Without sounding too projectivist about it, I would argue (as does Viereck, though only after much fussing and clearing away of dust raised by his own broom) that form—the pons asinorum of poetasters everywhere—is what emerges to make poetry successful and memorable, not poetry from pre-established form. As the Pound whom Viereck mocks once divined, “some poems may have form as a tree has form, some as water poured into a vase.” And surely there is a third possibility: that marmoreal stringency upon which the first Imagistes harped and which seems akin to what Michelangelo was getting at in the remark he made (about the David or the Moses, I don’t remember which), that form is achieved by liberating a creative ideality from the lumpen materials imprisoning it.

Nor does such restraining material need to be unyielding as stone or marble. Form in verse should be viewed as the shape a poem makes in air rather than as a template settled for or into on the printed page. Like Pound, I will never surrender the notion that poetry and music are any less separable than Aristotle’s form and matter. These ancient conjugalists must never be persuaded that, as lovers well over the hill, they must somehow relinquish coupledom because the modern age has forced them to choose between botox and carapace and they can only arrive at such choices solo. For some crazy reason, almost no one has fought the divvying up the spoilage of American music by popular culture moguls on the one hand, and lesser, museum-culture moguls promoting the odd inversion of “live” symphony orchestras stuck on “historic reissues” and an anything-but-live recording industry churning out “classic,” recycled performances—on the other. This inexplicably under-discussed pusillanimity has not only allowed a lot of faux-poetry to ‘scape whipping, but has let a good deal more scrape by on the minimum of the very chops that used to separate the Ovids from the Virgils, the Cavalcantis from the Guinicellis, or the Tennysons from the Arnolds in the exhibition catalogs of even second-rank connoisseurs. (The age-old question as to whether Dryden or Pope is the more “musical” poet remains however, still open.)

The chief assumptions of Peter Viereck in the essay cited above have all too often been enough to elevate the pseudo over the genuine in contemporary poetry. (It’s too bad that an excess of the sine qua nons—music and non-metrical rhythm—at the cost of almost everything else in a poem like The Cantos of Pound should support his argument if only by default, but let it pass.) For example, a warning bell sounds when Viereck assigns “rational purposes” to his defense of rhyme in today’s poetry:

The rational purposes of rhyme are clear enough: resonance, mnemonics, the interlace of lines into stanza structure, the slowing or speeding of enjambment (long or short vowels, voiced or unvoiced consonants), and connecting excitingly two words normally unlinked. But life, even nonhuman life, may also perhaps have irrational, downright mysterious needs for rhyme. Here is a seemingly preposterous example from the scholarly journal Ethology; a scientist analyzes the obsessive use of rhyme sounds in whale songs. Why? No one knows. Perhaps a memory aid, perhaps a mating call.

Reading this, there are many questions one would like to put to Viereck, such as: If it were discovered by sexologists that the majority of coital partners make rhyming noises when reaching orgasm, would that argue for or against the use of rhyme in verse? (We could, I suppose, poll the whales on this.) But it’s no use. Poets as socked into traditional notions about poetry and the vatic impulse as Viereck will not reason, purposefully or otherwise, about such issues. He insists, on top of everything else, on the inarguable indispensability of meter—“(sheer biology)”—and what he terms the “rhyme function.” His definition of the latter? “To link opposites into parallels, to orchestrate stanzas, to control the pace of enjambment, to create the sorcery of resonance,” tout court.

Actually, Viereck has a new wrinkle to propose vis à vis the salvaging of rhyme—in our culture at least—since “existing rhymes, in a language as uninflected as English, are so few that they are often hopelessly outworn (an often valid argument for free verse)”: “crisscross rhyme.” This introduces a chiasmus effect of rhyming “not any word and not the entire word of a line but the first syllable of a line with the last syllable of another line.” “Two gains” result from this, Viereck argues. “First,” he writes, “by separating syllables from words, you get rhymes never used before: a sense of freshness. Second, you now get front-of-line stress of rhythm. The resulting new sound and accent can produce an evocative body language and overthrow the tyranny of overaccenting the rhymed last syllable of a line.” How one avoids the concurrent sing-song effect of thudding iambics (or trochaics) with this, as in his own model, “EYELIDS”—

Image of ambush,
Hushingly dim:
Gold-bellied hornet
Hangs from the ceiling.
Torment is dangling
Feelers at men. . . .

—Viereck neglects to say.

It’s all somehow reminiscent of the cockamamie game played with poetics in the (now dated) verse play by Archibald MacLeish, J. B. For one thing—and Viereck, being a senior member of the poetic confraternity, should know this—poetry is essentially a rope bridge of vowels, while prose, whatever its Flaubertian pretensions, is a causeway of consonants. Even voiced consonants lack what the French prosodists call durée. Only vowels possess it, and in the variable quantities needed for the full range of rhythmic effects poetry requires for its meeting of body and mind. (Yes, poetry does hinge upon a “somantic” meeting of minds merging the semantic with the somatic functions of the human organum, but not, and most definitely not, the traditional one Viereck proposes.)

But even this hardnosed veteran of the Tweeds & Sandals war is not disposed to dismissing free verse altogether.

The kind of free verse I reject lacks body rhythm. The kind I admire has its own kind of secret body rhythm, subtly expressing the contents, and its own kind of “rhyme function,” though not rhyme itself. Nor do I reject all neoformalism, only the inexpressive regularity of the inhuman metronome rather than the heart. Expressive form today fights on two fronts. Most (not all) free verse is the artlessness that conceals artlessness. Most (not all) neoformalism verse is finger exercises.

Though evenhanded enough as a statement of principle, free verse, like the short-end-of-the-stick inhabitants of Orwell’s Animal Farm, ends up, in Viereck’s scales at least, considerably less weighty than its antagonist.

The original frisson of free verse was the reader’s unconscious expectation of some outworn regularity, now excitingly strained against. But today a new generation no longer expects the regularity that makes free verse irregular; thereby free verse becomes one more regularity, that of prose. Expressive form, by being both more irregular and more regular than free verse, can raise the tensions between human emotions to an almost unbearable pitch, both ecstatic and tragic, thereby achieving art’s double function: as rebel and as conserver. …

Or so it seems at first. But if we read on, we find, not too much further down the page, something of a retrenchment:

In the 1970s and 1980s, I believed that the formless variety of free verse was the main danger to American poetry, a revolt of 1912 that had ossified into a new conformity. In Frost’s overquoted words: tennis without the net. But today in 1993, at age 77, I believe that an equal menace to creativity is often emerging from the pendulum swing to a new formalism, not the organic expressive use of form but a dead mechanical form, artificial rather than based on the human biology of walking, breathing feeling. To reverse Frost: this is net without the tennis.

A decade earlier, Robert Hass, in an essay titled “Listening and Making,” appearing in the 1982 edition of The Random Review, had made the case for free as against neoformalist verse from a standpoint directly opposed to Viereck’s in the piece just discussed. It’s impossible to tell whether Viereck was familiar with Hass’s argument when he decided to add his two pence to the pot, but the two essays seem almost eerily symmetrical in their declared preferences. Hass is decidedly anti-stanza, anti-metrical, anti-rhyme, though he does agree with Viereck that “rhythm is always revolutionary ground.” “Statements about rhythm,” he declares,

emphasize its natural character. The rhythm of poetry is sometimes said to be based on the rhythm of work, but no one wonders then why we work rhythmically. The heartbeat—pa-thunk, pa-thunk, pa-thunk—is pointed to as a basis for rhythm, but if you think about it for a minute, it seems obvious that it is a little monotonous to account for much. Prosody is not much taught or talked about, since it was a form of institutional terrorism in the previous, metrical orthodoxy. And during this time, I think, there has been an observable falling off in the inventive force of poetry. A likely outcome would be an equally mindless metrical revival. And I think that would be too bad. The range of possibilities for the poem—from chant to prose—have been extended enormously in English in the last seventy years.

Hass believes that the non-metrical route is the proper future for American poetry because in their search for non-traditionalist means of achieving resolution in a poem, advocates of “open form” are unwilling to fudge the all-important distinction between closure and foreclosure. “The free-verse poem, by stripping away familiar patterns of recurrence and keeping options open . . . ,” this writer concludes,“ “is able to address the forms of closure with the sense that there are multiple possibilities that the poem has to find its way to the right one.”

But I anticipate the main thrust of Hass’s argument which lays out a most persuasive rationale for the anti-formalist breakthrough of the ‘50s, culminating in the mainly Projectivist anthology, The New American Poetry, which Donald M. Allen edited in 1960 for Grove Press. Hass’s commitment to open form is uncompromising. If his attitude toward some of the claims made for metrics falls somewhat sort of outright hostility, it is hardly sympathetic. The core of his viewpoint is an expansive one but still worth quoting at length:

The difference [between free and metrical verse] lies . . . in the stages of announcing and developing a rhythm. Every metrical poem announces a relationship to the idea of order at the outset, though the range of relationships to that idea it can suggest is immense. Free-verse poems do not commit themselves so soon to a particular order, but they are poems so they commit themselves to the idea of its possibility, and, as soon as recurrences begin to develop, an order begins to emerge. The difference is, in some ways, huge; the metrical poem begins with an assumption of human life which takes place in a pattern of orderly recurrence with which the poet must come to terms, the free-verse poem with an assumption of openness or chaos in which order must be discovered. Another way to say this is to observe that most metrical poems, by establishing an order so quickly, move almost immediately from the stage of listening for an order to the stage of hearing it in dialogue with itself. They suppress animal attention in the rush to psychic magic and they do so by laying claim to art and the traditions of art at the beginning. The free-verse poem insists on the first stage of sensual attention, of possibility and emergence—which is one of the reasons why it seemed fresher and more individual to the twentieth century. . . .

Calling upon Gary Snyder, Walt Whitman, and Louis Zukofsky as exemplars of a new way of conceiving modern prosody as the tensional alternation between three- and four-stress lines (citing along the way composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein’s observation: “Two is the rhythm of the body, three is the rhythm of the mind”), Hass counters the most valuable talking point of the traditionalists, the bodily origin of regularized poetic rhythm. There is no “organic” justification for the archtypically Whitmanian playing of three stresses off against four in line after line of his verse—most typically in the arch “decouplet”—

I loaf and invite my soul,

I lean and loaf at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.

—the pattern being, as Hass confirms, “three stresses in the first line, seven in the second with a strong pause after ease [. . . ] 3, 3/4.” And he finds the same controlled arhythmia in the three- or four-line stanzas of Zukofsky’s poem, “4 Other Countries”:

La Gloire in the black 2
flags of the valley 2
of the -
Loire 1

A lavender plough 2
in Windermere 1
The French blue 2
door 1

Of a gray 1
stone 1
house in 1
Angers 1

Walled farms 2
little lanes 2
of entry, orange- 2
red roofs 2

“The rhythm of this passage . . . doesn’t appear in the notation of the rhythm,” Hass insists, “because Zukofsky has broken it across the line, everywhere, into units of one or two stresses and passed the whole through the balanced proposal of the four-line stanza.” From there he elicits the complementary surmise that “the line, when a poem is alive in its sound, measures: it is a proposal about listening,” and from that pops out the rationale for his essay title, “Listening and Making.”

It would be lovely if every aspiring poet had the musical ear and rhythmic facility of a Zukofsky or a Pound, but very, very few do, and if their gifts in this highly concentrative area are formidable, they rarely have the depth of intellect or mastery over matter that the very greatest poets have in abundance. Wallace Stevens had, and John Ashbery has, an exceptional sense for the fluid line; yet neither, for all the inspired glitziness of their respective manners, manages to rise above the tautological pretentiousness of their matter all that often. (“Idea of Order at Key West” and “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror” remain the two most fatuously tautological poems by first-rank poets in the entire American language, but who can imagine being without either of them?) It’s hard to draw a bead on just what makes a superb poetic line superb, though Kenneth Burke did come close to pulling it off in his Philosophy of Literary Form nearly seventy years ago. Some of the most potent poetics are packed into mundane and utterly contentless phrases like puppy chow and ding dong (William Faulkner plucked this last one from certain doom—and before the King of Sweden, no less), so who can blame prosodists who throw up their hands when confronted yet again with the unchewable chestnut of just what it is in a line of poetry that sets an Emily Dickinson’s spine a-tingle or puts an A. E. Housman’s jugular at risk when the act of shaving crosses blades with blood-rippling verse.

Having negotiated those choppy waters, can anyone seriously argue, given today’s slate of attention-mopping disorders, that metrics and rhyme still serve a useful purpose in poetry, that they add so much as an iota of novelty to anything but their own dotty recidivism? Even skilled employers of the latter such as Shelley, writing when blank verse had to justify its existence all over again to an age up to its cravat in odes and rimes royal, showed in contrasting versions of Queen Mab that a good anti-Castlereagh diatribe could be laid low rather than improved by superadding chimes to its already overstrained percussion. Here is “Falsehood and Vice” in Queen Mab:

Since tyrants, by the sale of human life,
Heap luxuries to their sensualism, and fame
To their wide-wasting and insatiate pride,
Success has sanctioned to a credulous world
The ruin, the disgrace, and woe of war.
His hosts of blind and unresisting dupes
The despot numbers; from his cabinet
These puppets of his schemes he moves at will,
Even as the slaves by force or famine driven,
Beneath a vulgar master, to perform
A task of cold and brutal drudgery;—
Hardened to hope, insensible to fear,
Scarce living pulleys of a dead machine,
Mere wheels of work and articles of trade,
That grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth!

And here, with rhyme, is Queen Mab-Lite:

Whilst monarchs laugh’d upon their thrones
To hear a famished nation’s groans,
And hugged the wealth wrung from the woe
That makes its eyes and veins o’erflow,—
Those thrones, high built upon the heaps
Of bones where frenzied Famine sleeps,
Where Slavery wields her scourge of iron,
Red with mankind’s unheeded gore,
And War’s mad fiends the scene environ,
Mingling with shrieks a drunken roar,
There Vice and Falsehood took their stand,
High raised above the unhappy land.

Woe, o’erflow; heaps, sleeps; gore, roar: how many times have these and similar breakers crashed upon the shores of poesy? And how much longer must they need to? One hundred and fifty years after Shelley, straggling mutants of these same sounds can be heard beaching themselves in these lines from Derek Mahon’s “Table Talk”:

You think I am your servant but you are wrong—
The service lies with you. During your long
Labours at me, I am the indulgent wood,
Tolerant of your painstaking ineptitude.
Your poems were torn from me by violence;
I am here to receive your homage in dark silence.

Remembering the chain-saw surgery and the seaward groan,
Like a bound and goaded exodus from Babylon,
I pray for a wood-spirit to make me dance,
To scare you shitless and upset your balance,
Destroy the sedate poise with which you pour
Forth your ephemeral stream of literature. . . .

Anything, even being scared shitless, is preferable to floating becalmed on this ephemeral stream of literature. However, Mahon has got one thing right: only a table could talk in so wooden and constricted a manner for twenty-four lines. And he’s no doubt owed a beer for having at last settled the pronunciation of “wood,” “groan,” and “pour” as wude, grawn, and pure respectively. Learning that these fitly rhyme with such odd-chiming words as “ineptitude,” “Babylon, and “literature” has caused a small corner of the veil of ignorance to be lifted—at least on this side of the word processor. But weren’t these meant as slant- or off-rhymes and not full rhymes at all, you ask, and isn’t that more than just skittles? Don’t be so sure, I say. In Mahon’s “Table Talk” we may have a poet whose “acknowledgement of convention” (to quote Richard Howard on a poem by Daryl Hine) is “so rapt we may wonder where the freedom is,” but in this enclosure of strong measures, raptness is all, and wrappedness, its homonymic twin, all, sundry, and just about everything in between. And isn’t it precisely this—Shelley’s couplets gone unheroic—that got our poetry into its present fix in the first place?

     Unless very skillfully choreographed, interviews with poets are at best temporizing exercises (to show one is still alive creatively); at worst, a crushing bore. Those who have sampled the Mandelbrot sequence of sitdowns showcased by The New York Quarterly since the 1970’s can hardly fail to confirm this; though it is arguable that the fault more often lies with the interviewing journal’s protocols than with the “stars” lured to its hot seat. This is precisely incomparable to what happens when such questionnaires are put to writers of fiction. Which is no doubt why, roughly speaking, interviews with novelists outnumber interviews with poets by at least five to one. (The Paris Review remains of course a prime candidate for exemption here, being among literary journals not only a horse of a different color, but a thoroughbred of a most singular color.) But then, the working habits of novelists are nearly always more interesting to literary groupies than those of poets because, let’s face it, they tend to be a good deal less strange than the gossip-ghouls who hang upon their every word. This is in no way meant to suggest that poets don’t attract their own unique school of bottom feeders. It’s just that when we get right down to it, it’s hard to get a handle on what it is poets do when they’re alone with their muse and still not quite at the point of invoking W. H. Auden’s notorious ruse for rousing her. The skinny on poets is that they hide the techniques they use to get the inspirational juices flowing even from those they’re intimate with. This is not because they think their modus operandi should be kept from prying eyes, but because any attempt to reduce to small talk the game of six-dimensional chess they play with language when confronting the tribunal of white paper (or unfinishable draft) would collapse immediately into gibberish. Also, the poet who sits down every day to write, whether driven to or not, at exactly the same time is a rare lyre-bird indeed. Professional novelists, if not continually distracted by teaching duties, tend to keep regular hours and do their research and the writing and editing of the various drafts of their work-in-progress in a systematic but hardly hieratic way. Certainly, the last thing on their agenda is working word puzzles for sound, sense and subject rhymes all at once.

None of which stops major—and minor—poets from pretending in interviews that idiosyncratic and even nutty ways of producing poems 1)  can be made intelligible and/or comprehensible; and 2) are of any use whatever to the readers of the interview. Which is precisely what prevents the salient lore dispensed by the five poets “talked with” in this new collection of tête à têtes edited by Harry Thomas from being anything more than a passel of idiot-savants opining frankly about a craft which, if Harold Bloom can be believed, goes about its business of communing with the dead as documentably as Eliot’s Madame Sosostris in that poet’s The Waste Land. Conducted (with the exception of the one with Michael Hofmann) by students enrolled in Thomas’s university class in the “Art of Poetry,” these exchanges can be deemed illuminating only if what they cover by way of direction is ignored in favor of what ends up coming to the surface through indirection, and by that I mean the poet’s, not the interviewers’. Short of that, it’s nothing less than dispiriting to find a Nobel prizewinner like the Irish poet, Seamus Heaney, hemming and hawing his way through an answer to a perfectly straightforward (albeit multilayered) question: “. . . [How] do you feel your time spent in America has affected your writing . . . [and has] it changed your thinking about Ireland?” “I don’t know the answer to that,” Heaney, fresh out of temporizations, admits. Would that he had left it there; for barely pausing to get his bearings, he proceeds to treat a hand that had nothing for openers as though it had the makings of a full house.

. . . I think it has changed my writing a bit. I’m not sure that it has
much affected my attitude to Ireland, because Ireland, Northern
Ireland in particular, is a form of entrapment that nobody can
help you with. And it has to be known from the inside. Outsiders
can solve it like that [snaps his fingers]! Solutions straight away—
bang, bang, bang. Why don’t you dee dee dee? Why didn’t you
da da da? Because . . . [Heaney does a Neanderthal slump and
stare]. I think my being here might indeed have affected my
writing . . . made me ready to improvise a bit, to open up and
skim along. I think the poems in Seeing Things, those twelve-
liners, might have something to do with—not with the influence
of American poetry—but with the space-walk aspect of my own
life here. I think being here might have added more confusion
than clarity to my understanding of things . . . Speaking, I mean,
in literary terms. . . .

     The reference to “literary terms” somehow triggers an impulse to call his own bluff and Heaney is again off to the races, handicapper sheet in tow. (Excuse the lengthiness of the quote to follow, but as even poets have admitted in interviews, sometimes going the extra mile is required to put a foot right where you started.)

. . . Within my first ear, within my first literary hearing, because my
ear was formed by British, Irish, English, Scottish literature and rhythms
and meters and sounds, I would be intolerant of a lot of the open-
weave talkiness of American poetry. But since coming here I’ve realized 
that I respond like that because of my first closed and tense expectations.
I’ve realized it’s part of the American idiom, it’s part of a different culture,
it’s part of a different project, a different ambition. So I’ve got a kind of
laissez-faire now in myself towards things that I was agin’ in the beginning.
I’m not sure whether that is a gain or a loss. I think that as a reader you
can have tolerance that you mustn’t allow yourself as a writer. You can
listen in and say, “yeah, yeah, yeah,” but you mustn’t admit that to
which you say “yeah, yeah, yeah” into your writing because then you
become untrue to yourself. I mean, all you have to go on as a writer is
your sixth sense and your sense of the world and your ear and your
instincts. There are many other things which you can include or address,
but if as a poet you’re not on the beam, if you aren’t coming in on the
radar system that belongs in your own ground, you’re not actually
destined to land safely. Maybe I’ve been over fearful of opening up to
other influences. I can hear a lot going on, but I don’t let it get into my
writing. There are only two or three references to the United States in
all of my written work. It’s not that I’m against it. It’s just that I haven’t
found a way to get at it. . . . (Italics the editor’s.)

But for the out-of-country references to British, Irish, English and Scottish literature in this creek-of-consciousness dambuster, there’s not a whole lot preventing us from attributing it to a writer like Jack Kerouac. No, strike that—not to a writer like Jack Kerouac, to the Big Slur author himself. In humbly reserving to itself only some of the dharma, self-reculpatory commentary like this makes one wonder where all the rest of it went. After fifteen pages of sitdown, there’s little that sticks to the ribs—a sweet-and-sour pork rib here, a mostly foreskin buffalo wing there. Almost everywhere are the sorts of disclaimers that recall nothing so much as the testimony—Fifth Amendment-studded—given before the House Un-American Activities Committee by witnesses such as Clifford Odets back when Ridealong Cassady’s sidekick was deserting town and city to take his medicine show on the road. Asked if he thought his poems “from the beginning were growing in some way rather than changing,” Heaney skirts the personal for the oracular and nods (some would say, ostentatiously) his acquaintance with one of Delphi’s more questionable graduates. “That’s a very good question,” he replies tactfully. “If I had a clear answer to it, I would feel like Yeats felt after he wrote A Vision: totally empowered and ready to go again in my sixties.”  Perhaps what keeps Yeats’s magic as a word man alive (except in Ireland, where even the elderly now view him as hopelessly century-before-last) is that he never had to face the students of Professor Thomas’s “Art of Poetry” class with a tape recorder running. Still, one can’t help feeling gored, along with Heaney, by at least one horn of that dilemma which poets must regularly face: Admit that, whatever you might pretend, you’ve really no idea how those poems of yours got written and risk looking the fool Plato’s Republic made commonplace; or bob and weave your mysterium into being, which, with the flourish of an added mustache, courtesy of Marcel Duchamp, will (to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln) promptly remove all doubt.

Mostly, though, the good things in Talking with Poets are not found in the pretentious, programmatic pronunciamentos of this poet or that, but in some of the adventitious recollections of what has come up in small talk about poetry over the decades. For example, David Ferry, celebrated for his ongoing translation of the works of Horace, recalls in the context of Robert Frost having said that “things live in the cave of the mouth,” that

 . . . while you’re trying to avoid sounding like somebody else you’re
at the same time using the way the English language has behaved
rhythmically as you’ve heard it elsewhere. We don’t make up anything
in our language. It’s all, in a sense, memory. It’s, as Frost says, “things
that live in the cave of the mouth,” that were always there. You don’t
make it out of nothing. You make language out of nothing. You make
language out of language. It’s both trying not to sound like other
people and using ad hoc what’s gotten into your ear.

     Poets are almost always more interesting talking around themselves talking about other poets, other things, than they are talking about their own work, their work-in-progress, their progress toward other work. Michael Hofmann, German born and discoursing in English, knows enough to talk as English readers expect him to talk outside the largely deserted canton of his native speech. He obliges them by sounding ever so grateful to be exiting the orbit of German, into the freer air of unconstrained transliteration of thought. As a young student, he confides, “I read Lowell and Enzenberger. Basically, I wanted to write a cross of the two. The perception of Enzenberger and the splendor of Lowell.” Hofmann is least pedestrian as a spokesman for altered states of, rather than in, poetic language in his brief disquisition on the travails of Chinese poetry in English—the Tong wars between the Waleys, the Rexroths, the Vikram Seths, and—well, the Pound of everyman’s Cathay.

 . . . I love Chinese poetry. Chinese poetry is one of these irreducible
things, I think. Whenever I read something really good, say, Akhmatova,
it seems to have a sort of percentage of what seems to me to be Chinese
poetry. Or it has the sort of Chinese feeling. Man in space. A bundle of
memories and feelings and senses in a vast void. I think those things
are just perfect—tiny, physical notations, obliquity, and an absolutely
direct emotional statement at the end. “Cho-fu-sa.”

     Chinese poetry might just be the lo-carb diet called for after too heavy an indulgence in  Enzenberger and Lowell, not to mention Joseph Brodsky, whose verse Hofmann also says he admires. And Hofmann prefers his Chinese verse, or at least his Chinese verse in translation, straight. No surfeit of scholarly paraphernalia, no notes, no facing texts in original inscrutablese to make the novice edgy:

. . . I think it tends to be a bad sign when books of Chinese poetry come
with long notes and present the Chinese en face. I think you’re in for a
hard time when you read them. Whereas Cathay, it’s sort of flagrant; it
declares the inauthenticity of the words, and it’s perfect for what you get.
And I suppose I would say that’s always more or less what you’re going
to get in English. When you get the great imports, when you read, say,
Marquez in English, you get a Latin Americanized flavor, Einschlag. It’s
not real Columbian [sic] or real Chinese, but it’s from the extremities of
English. It’s got on leather chaps and a flat black hat, and wow, you
think, this is great.

     The “extremities of English” is a stunning concept, redolent not of ghettoes and barrios of expropriated English—those detention cages of hip hop, Chicano-ese or ebonics (which is to say, the slums of today’s sacrosanct “multiculturalism”)—but of the outer reaches of the Whole String-Theoried Enchilada: the Angloid universe, duly franchised with Dark Side, beyond even where Trekkies conventioneer to parse the semiotics (liberally doused with Ayn Rand) of “boldly go”’s unrestricted Enterprise.    

     There are echoes of this—that if poets are condemned to speak in tongues, they are fortunate when the tongue they are condemned to speak in is English—in remarks by the other interviewees as well. English is an endlessly self-renewing language, full of weeds that turn miraculously into diamond bits like Pound’s sassafras, or “rock-drill.” It is near to chaos, a hurricane’s eye, one of the gamiest of verbal preserves, whose borders are infiltrated at every crossing point by aliens legal and illegal, by chaps with flat hats and floozies with no known passports. And yet it not only continues to survive more or less intact, but thrives on its most harshly absorbed antigens, like capitalism, a perduring prodigy of unresolved—some might even say unresolvable—contradictions. Seamus Heaney is particularly endearing (if that’s not too patronizing a word) on the subject of English’s lust for antibodies and its never-say-die refusal not be reborn whenever a truly ground-clearing poet appears to rock its solubles to their very foundationalisms.

 . . . I had written an essay on [Gerard Manley] Hopkins because Hopkins
was deeply, deeply important to me. And I was saying in it that he was
very masculine in his deliberate, forcing way with words. But, after all,
he was helplessly suffering his own linguistic processes. Those words
came out. It was as if the English language was hatching in him. The
language had been waiting to be born again since Langland, and 
suddenly it came to him again. Sprung rhythm was a new birth of
Anglo-Saxon poetry and the old genius of English came through again.
So, there was a kind of birth-giving process there.

            Had these five poets in the course of their interrogations remained above ground and avoided the catacombs of trying to account for the unaccountable, less odor of sanctity would be detected hanging over some of these exchanges. For the most part, the worst sort of Brewster Ghiselinizing is avoided and when it is, things stroke ahead swimmingly. Levine and Pinsky, for example, are forthright and even feisty about the dereliction of duty and craft discernible in many creative writing programs across America. Levine considers a sanguine development the sense, newly hatched in America, that everyone could become a poet, but he pulls no punches when reminding us that “too many writing programs . . . staffed by people who can’t write themselves” is not just a scandal, it’s a bloody shame. It’s when he expatiates for pages on how he “scouts” a poem before writing it that page turning turns into a turning away from the tropisms Levine tries to convince us made him hope to turn again. (Presumably, even his poem “Scouting,” about the summer of 1954 spent in the North Carolina “mountain town” of Boone, was “scouted.”) Or when Robert Pinsky goes on about his Irish mother’s metonymizing of “windholes” for windows long enough to make us wish we had a page turner’s equivalent of a pruner or a hook to reach for:

 . . [Sometimes] you discover the plainness in the learnedness. It is
delightful to discover that the origin of a word like “window” may be
something as homely or simple as “windhole.” Is that a “learned
etymology”? In a way, but what could be more down-home, what
could be plainer? It’s [pointing] the windhole, the hole where the
wind comes in. Is that a piece of arcane learning, or a bit of
fundamental, funky information about these brutal Anglo-Saxons
in their hut with its windhole?

     One of Harry Thomas’s fledglings (Ann Brooke Lewis) lapsed into a miscalculation. She apparently thought that if she asked the poet to elaborate on his poem “Window” he might sidle neatly into an informative jog clarifying “how much history or culture actually is in your language?” What she got—and we’re asked to wade through—is an elaborate sidebar on hardware, etymology, the sociology of idiom, and plain-speaking about matters so plain that speaking about them at length beyond the alimentary canal of the poem’s own discourse strikes this reader at least as bombast by another name, but still bombast. Not that I’m blaming Pinsky, or any of the other poets talked with here, for this ambuscade loosed on the reader’s attention span. My purpose in adverting to it is not to pile recrimination upon ballyhoo, but to reiterate what was said earlier about the subterfuges of poets under stress of the third degree. Too nonplussed to disinter a modus operandi on demand, poets might well stop what they're doing and consider having a Sir Philip Sidney moment. Thus, when told by their Muse to "look in their hearts and write," they might describe how on one splendid occasion they had a sacred tryst with language, the result of which, sired upon that occasion, was such as to not only merit awe as a masterpiece (however slight), but to make them feel that for once--for once--as a poet something more had occurred than the mere date rape of words or (the severe Charley horse experienced afterwards notwithstanding) a Bloomian set-to with some musclemouthed poet linked to them forever as Oedipal Other.

And isn’t it precisely that which separates the iron-butted practitioners of the novel from the wild boys and girls of the verse racket? Lacking the moxie of novelists, poets feel incessantly set upon by the “Three H’s”—habitude, hebetude and hobbitude. The first has to do with the silly little tricks poets must play on themselves in order to “unlock their word-hoard” (as the Beowulf poet would have it) and get started. (Among professional athletes, such tricks involve an enabling superstition centering on a talisman, like a “lucky” article of clothing, that will cause them to win.) The second (also associated with superstitiousness of a sort) relates to the slavish servility with which poets (and certain idiots-savant) submit to language as though it were the very armature of the cosmic All. Finally, the third concerns the propensity that poets share with hobbits (according to the inventor of those creatures, J. R. R. Tolkien) to “have little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.”

            Again, none of these predations serves to make the practicing poet one whit more fascinating to those who would either probe his or her innermost workings or look over others’ shoulders while they try to do so. All of which makes it almost certain that the poor sot some literary journal assigns to interview National Book Award winner A or National Critics’ Circle Award winner B will come in for some heady wagging at the hands of an interlocutor determined (in the interest of furthering his own reputation) to make the marriage of a supersensitive ear and hit-or-miss word alchemy seem a triumphant synergy between tradition and a quite remarkable individual talent. For you see, fiction writers (however Flaubertian their tradition) almost never confront or are hobbled by such drawbacks, being on drinking terms (or darksomely familiar in some other way) with Fact, Verisimilitude, Dissimulation, and the rest of that Boar’s Head bunch. They can talk openly, and with reasonable accuracy, about their craft because they feel no embarrassment or lack of secure election before either their constituency or their muse. Since they are helots of routine they tend to develop pig-iron butts which permit them accommodation to the strict writing regimens they set for themselves. Over the span of a writerly career, quirks appear; twitches of judgment become habitual out of which a style slowly begins to emerge, the discussion of which constitutes the desired nuggets, and not just the ore, of interviews with successful novelists. A Voice, already authoritative, ends by self-authorizing the means by which it makes the law of the canon its own canon law. One calmly answered question leads to another, and before the reader can say Sven Birkerts, the atelier of an Updike or a DeLillo is pried open like an oyster, revealing secrets known previously to none but the Balboas and the Magellans of the novelistic world. How do fiction writers work? How does their writing interface with the less creative responsibilities of life? Do their political beliefs impinge on the creative process as they write? Is it okay to give free rein to these beliefs, or should their comet trails be monitored and their effects limited? Finally, how do writers personally view their rivals in the trade, what Norman Mailer in 1959 broadbanded as “the talent in the room”? Is there a genuine community of writers, or is it all just self-positioning for a one-on-one with the Trough?

So, where does that leave us? Does it really matter that, after having slogged the length and relative breadthlessness of Talking with Poets, we are really no nearer to knowing how the making of a Seamus Heaney poem differs from that of a Robert Pinsky, Philip Levine, David Ferry or Michael Hofmann poem than we are to an acceptable answer to the question repeatedly posed by Michael Moore (even to an Alzheimered-out Charlton Heston) in his award-winning documentary film Bowling for Columbine, “Why should Canada, a country of 30 million residents and 7 million firearms, have the lowest gun mortality rate in the world, while the USA, with more or less the same ratio of guns to mongoloids as its neighbor to the north, have what is by far the highest?” Does Moore’s failure to throw light on the matter (beyond some weak speculation that the relentless scare tactics pursued by the mass media for profit might have something to do with it) deprive his movie of serious value? Of course not. There will always be poetry readers interested in discovering how the poets they admire go about crafting their verse, even if the craft in question was adduced ad hoc in the course of the interview. Then, too, the pet peeves of poets are often as, or even more, revealing of what makes them tick than who or what they claim to admire in the, let’s face it, adversarial world of their contemporaries. For example, Philip Levine sounds off rather testily (and without a whole lot of provocation) on the notion of poetic movements:

Ever since I began writing I’ve noticed that certain movements are there
mainly to help people without talent write something they can pass off as
poetry. If you can’t tell a decent story, denounce poems that tell stories.
If you can’t create characters, denounce poems with people in them. If
you can’t create images, write boring generalities. If you have no sense
of form, imitate the formlessness of the sea. If you have no ear, disparage
music. If everything you write is ugly and senseless, remind your readers
the world is ugly and senseless. Bad poets are incredibly resourceful. But
those are movements that are easily forgotten. . . .
 

     Though this indictment isn’t without some truth, the sheer bravura of its tact in refusing to name names reminds one just how carefully players in the poetry game must tread, how few backs can afford to be raked which might someday require more gentle scratching. It might also bring to mind one of the innumerable travesties of that oversung formalist, Joyce Kilmer—

Movements are made
By fools like me,
But only God
Can shit a tree.

     In Levine’s defense, he does draw in one “movement” of recent years but fails to cite any malefactors specifically.

About fifteen years ago we had something called the New Formalism,
and it seems to have vanished already. Very curious movement, a sort
of nostalgia for the poetry of the fifties and perhaps the decade itself,
and it occurred at a time when the best formal poets of the fifties—Wilbur,
Merrill, Hecht, Nemerov—were still writing incredibly well. The important
movements change the way we see poetry or poetry sees us.

     Obliquely alluded to here of course are collections of “poetry in traditional forms” like Dacey and Jauss’s Strong Measures (1986), which might have merited a plug rather than a poke for its having reignited interest in the formal verse of the poets he mentions and a sizeable number of others, from Donald Justice to Howard Moss. (Actually, Levine himself contributed three poems to that anthology, in company with other “New Formalists,” such as Denise Levertov, Frank O’Hara, and Gary Snyder.)

            But perhaps I’m being a tad unfair myself. For all the make-work noodling, Talking with Poets does throw out some fascinating sidelights on poems already written and out there. Nor is there any shortage of insights into how poets, in order to make a poem happen, steer themselves down paths hitherto unexplored. Even, one might say, when the end in view (as with Robert Pinsky’s Mindwheel) is a “text adventure game” for computers, using poetry as a riddle-solving—ah, what the hell, let’s be honest: gimmick. “Where text appears on the screen . . . and in response to each bit of narrative, which ends with a prompt,” Pinsky explains, “you decide whether to go north or to look around a room, say.” The answer to one such riddle “prompted by some lines from Walter Ralegh—

this tumult shall not cease
Until an herald shall proclaim a peace,
An herald strange, the like was never born
Whose very beard is flesh, and mouth is horn.

—is “rooster”; but while solving word puzzles, the player of the game is also subtly made to appreciate the intrinsic musicality of lines like “Whose very beard is flesh, and mouth is horn.”

It sounds good, and it sounds good as a syntax [sic], as well as
an arrangement of consonant and vowels, and it sounds good as
an unformulated recognition of other kinds of fact: the fact that
“flesh” and “horn” are good words here, and the fact that horn 
means the substance of fingernails as well as the bony process
of, say, a ram’s horn, and that the ram’s horn makes a pleasing
connection with “herald,” because it’s the same word—to blow
into a horn, a goat’s or ram’s horn. That’s how we have the word
“horn,” which we now apply to a sax or a trumpet, instruments
made not of horn but of brass. And a jazz musician will call his
piano or drum set his “horn”! And so forth, through innumerable
chimes and associations. A horny thing is a callous, a hardening
of the flesh. There is a sexual component to the to the flesh and
horn and born and morning, and certainly to the buried image
of the rooster.

     Pinsky has said in writing about T. S. Eliot that “True poetry is never really misunderstood or discarded, because its basis is in pleasure. Explanations and theories are misunderstood; pleasures are either had, or not.” By the same token, the process by which the pleasures provided by an Eliot or Mallarmé poem are assured may be judged successful or unsuccessful, but its explanation is susceptible only to being misunderstood by absolutely everyone, including, as Plato insisted long ago, the poet herself. Eliot was a firm believer in the power of great poetry to be appreciated before it was understood and it’s hard not to concur with Pinsky’s own conviction “that if you write whatever it is well enough—Wallace Stevens is a good author to demonstrate this with—the reader will put up with quite a lot of incomprehension. . . .” I think Pinsky is right on the money about this. I would bring to his case only the most circumstantial of alterations, and that about Wallace Stevens, who isn’t simply a good author for demonstrating this point. He is, next to Mallarmé, Valéry and Eliot himself, the best author for demonstrating it. What would be the best Chinese whisper, ever? No contest: Stevens’s explanation to the Paris Review of how he composed “The Comedian as the Letter C.”  But there’d be nothing to whisper. He never made one.

          That poetry often hides its light in a bushel of serviceable prose ligatures is something we tend less to forget than work at banishing from our minds intentionally. Just as to some, the writings of an Ammons or an Ashbery offend by thrusting the sentence, already fronting the poet’s insensate thought, further along toward its proscenium’s edge, at times by adopting the hectoring tone of a lecturer and at others by simply extending lines from the page’s far-left margin all the way to the far right. We easily lose sight of how near to the fourteener’s margin of errancy much traditional verse routinely strays, and that does not exclude poems in which metrical regularity is not so much a disguise as the formal donning of a masque (no, that’s not a spelling error) by other means. Consider for a moment Sidney’s Astrophil and Stella. There, surely, is a poem which, rather than hugging the shore with embalming timidity, embraces the sea with all its unplumbed fathoms as both trusted friend and colloquial familiar:

Loving in truth, and faine in verse my love to show,

                        That the deare She might take some pleasure of my paine:

                        Pleasure might cause her reade, reading might make her know,

                        Knowledge might pitie winne, and pitie grace obtaine,

                         I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,

                        Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertaine:

                        Oft turning others’ leaves, to see if thence would flow

                        Some fresh and fruitfull showers upon my sunne-burn’d braine. . . . 

          Hard as it might be not to sacrifice intimacy when steering an off-road vehicle chuffing dodecasyllabics, Sidney was clearly one to essay such multi-tasking. What kept his verse from more than an occasional descent into blabber was the innovative way, locked and loaded within a syntactic frame suggesting anything but a hunter provisioned for big game, it stalked its imagery. In more recent times, poets like Ashbery have sounded the angelus of the New by reversing Sidney-esque dynamics and letting the somewhat daffy interlocutor of his verse blow smoke-rings of surmise into an air pocket heavily polluted with a turgidity for which the network of tightasses promoting greater cultural anality can take full credit:

                        Barely tolerated, living on the margin

                        In our technological society, we were always having to be rescued

                        On the brink of destruction, like heroines in Orlando Furioso

                        Before it was time to start all over again.

                        There would be thunder in the bushes, a rustling of coils,

                        And Angelica, in the Ingres painting, was considering

                        The colorful but small monster near her toe, as though wondering,

                                    whether forgetting

                        The whole thing might not, in the end, be the only solution.

                        And then there always came a time when

                        Happy Hooligan in his rusted green automobile

                        Came plowing down the course, just to make sure everything

                                    was O.K.,

                        Only by that time we were in another chapter and confused

                        About how to receive this latest piece of information.

                        Was it information? Weren’t we rather acting this out

                        For someone else’s benefit, thoughts in a mind

                        With room enough and to spare for our little problems (so they

                                    began to seem),

                        Our daily quandary about food and the rent and bills to be paid? . . . 

         But then, poems like “Soonest Mended” (just quoted) are notoriously the outgrowth of distractions encouraging contours of enticing irrelevance to conform themselves to the shapes (ever decomposing) of mindfulness left to idle on the shoulder of life’s via dolorosa—though this achieves little more than raising to the exponent of the highfalutin the conventional wisdom that prose (albeit in a disorderly form) remains: a) the natural medium of the mind in repose; or b) the loquacious equivalent of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “solitary walker’s reverie” as picturesquely limned in his slim book of that title (pick one). For prose must also be—if information theorists are to be believed—a sparse flatland traversable by information without whose authority the medium cannot master the circumstantial and lay claim to the consequential, a feat attainable by none but the greatest poems, and then only by plurisignative default of all but the strongest qualifiers able to offset sublimity’s Grand Design. The revolutionary assault launched by Rimbaud on convention-laden verse in the 1860’s and 1870’s was originally an effort designed to revivify a French prose flogged to bloody bits by futuristic Pharisees intent on earning Hugo awards for stentorian valor, but soon assumed the character of a crusade against mediocre Parnassien-isme too drenched in attar of roses to sniff out le fin du monde en avançant springing up everywhere around them. 

          The problem with most asseverations seeking to sever poetry from prose is that they are so finely granulated that they preclude the posing of certain basic ontogenetic questions without whose input the problem of just what (rather than where) poetry proceeds from, or how its operating system accommodates itself to the passing phenomenological scene as something parsable rather than a mere eidolon which meaning courts with little but flirtation on its mind dissolves into a plethora of survey-course evasions. What devotees of “pure poetry” have never been able to wrap their minds around is the nefarious inherency found in language which can make it appear a “monstrosity of disseminative différance” to worshippers of Joyce and others eager to associate polyphiloprogenitive atom-smashings like Finnegans Wake with actual particle accelerators such as The Book of Kells. Watching over the last decade or two the most recent wave of poststructuralists do their Derridean thing with an avidity redolent of proctologists on crack has for many lovers of literature been something they would not like soon to see repeated. Even the atypicalities of a Paul Célan, however recursive their clenched poetics, remain keyed to prose skeletons without whose minimalist ribcages even the bleakest cerementary sackcloths could fail to interiorize a semantic shape. As much as the flight of “prose paraphrasability” from a Mallarmé sonnet might resemble jetées of fat globules in a sauté-pan ballet, the nimbus thrown up by all those implosions of lipidity is as reducible to the “good cholesterol” of grammar and Wittgensteinian analyzability as any Nonsense poem by Edward Lear or Lewis Carroll. Fortunately, the awareness of the dangers posed to poetry by over-wide pendulum swings away from conventional prosaics returns every generation or so like the good penny we would be well advised to take it for. The reason for this is not far to seek, since with a providentiality that is as magical as the re-appearance of the phenomenon itself, there almost always appears alongside it a Rimbaud, a Whitman, or a William Carlos Williams who, with a sequence of stunning veronicas, turns aside the stampede of poetasters determined to obscure all naturally lucid advertence with flushings of rhetoric aimed at convincing the credulous that the metallic quackery of mechanical ducks of the sort for which the 18th Century French illusionist Vaucanson was known is nothing less than whole-cloth oracularism on the wing.  

Imagine “Western Wynde” without its bowsprit of indemnity against sehnsucht; or an Anne Sexton verse-camisole without its unfastenable—“Wait, Mister”—hook-and-eye; or a Shakespeare sonnet without its rock-steady terminal cadence providing its separation-grief with sufficient closure to hold it until the next pairing of octave and sestet in the sequence commences. It’s neither possible nor for that matter even desirable to do so—though praising poetry unalloyed by Fregean Sinn is still de rigueur in circles unrattled by the until-now persistent lull in the “poem as food-fight” approach to Bedeutung embraced by the Fanny Howe/Alice Notley school of drip-dry poetics. The mastery of expression in prose is, as Northrop Frye pointed out years ago in a Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (1962) article, a much more sophisticated development culturally than the vast pre-history of gists and piths chalked up by scops, skalds, and others who made the dipodic a hospicious half-way house between split-screen heroics and the unified sensibility. While not necessarily superior to the oneirically fertilized ova of visionary pumpkin-eaters, verse may itself be said to function as a midpoint between the blurts and charms of “naked poetry” and the Escher-like allurements of a steroid-enhanced prose with attitude. Which latter, by the way, is in no sense a kissing cousin of conversational speech, whose heartily un-Escher-like tropisms communicate more through what may be seen falling through its cracks than via anything likely to ally it with what language theorists like John R. Searle term “speech acts.” Prose is idealized talk, which analogizes it to wordage thrown on the potter’s wheel of molten locutions and manually rounded idiomatics rather than runic haikus or bits of Snyder-esque “rip-rap.” Among its consanguinities not too far removed is the sort of “associational poetry” that Amy Lowell drew the ire of Ezra Pound for having blithely tossed off and which Wallace Stevens carved into sand sculptures as tidally swampable as his early “O Florida, Venereal Soil”—

                        A few things for themselves,

                        Convolvulus and coral,

                        Buzzards and live-moss,

                        Tiestas from the keys,

                        A few things for themselves,

                        Florida, venereal soil,

                        Disclose to the lover.

 

                        The dreadful sundry of this world,

                        The Cuban, Polodowsky,

                        The Mexican women,

                        The negro undertaker

                        Killing the time between corpses

                        Fishing for crayfish . . .

                        Virgin of boorish births,

 

                        Swiftly in the nights,

                        In the porches of Key West,

                        Behind the bougainvilleas,

                        After the guitar is asleep . . . . 

At the furthest end of the same Freudian fort-da may be noted the here-and-there’s of Gertrude Stein and her guild of zanies which dilates to take in even the spot-on minstrel-wanderings into sublimity of a Louis Zukofsky, though the author of “A” would doubtless disaffirm any direct linkage with bric-a-brac from Stein’s atelier. Her repetitive incrementality may be less regimented than that normally encountered in stanzaic poetry, but its inchworm progresses are less tolerant of internal variation than much verse parceled out in regular line-forms. The categorials of Stein’s Tender Buttons (1914)—“Objects,” “Food,” “Rooms”—exhaust their potential for sound and conjuration not through embracing the precinctual ceintures of the prose poem but by extending the Soviet-era “sound poem’’s demesne deeper and more extenuatingly into full-blown incantorials than the run-of-the-mill prose litany of non-particulars. Take, for instance, “Apple” from her “Food” column:

             Apple, plum, carpet steak, seed clam, colored wine, calm

            seen, cold cream, best shake, potato, potato and no no gold

            work with pet, a green seen is called bake and change sweet

            is bready, a little piece, a little piece please.

             A little piece please. Come again to the presupposed and

            ready eucalyptus tree, count out sherry and ripe plates and

            little corners of a kind of ham. This is use. 

          Here, Stein’s “prose” (the scare quotes cannot be dispensed with) is crumbly as tea-cake, yet remains prose beyond the claims of all other proclivities, despite its laying out with carbon chain-like mappability what is among the strangest gastronomical itineraries on record. Poetry, though itself associational by dint of license afforded by its tropes, averts succumbing to the crumblies unless through loss of control due to such things as pilot error, it becomes indecently conjoined with morsels of talk. Its atoms, favoring aggregation in colloidal masses, careen beyond the orbit of trackable particles (and particulars) with which prose routinely consorts, gravitating irresistibly towards the metaphorical (as opposed to the metonymic), the self-reversible (as opposed to the self-identifying), and irrefragable (as opposed to the distinctional and extrapolative). As soon imagine a diamond reduced to dust by a human fist as envisage a symbol reduced to its constituent signs by a parsing hammer. A metaphor—and what are symbols if not categorical limits arbitrarily imposed upon exponentially expandable metaphors?—has the consistency, indeed the viscosity, of a globule of mercury: it can be broken down only into smaller, less scrunchable versions of itself. Which is precisely why prose resists globulization with all the force at its disposal, consenting to be other than narrative, or discourse, or memorandum fodder only when its play of semes and apparencies find the siren-call of the self-referential resistible in no other way. 

            Since the ascendancy of Vladimir Mayakovsky during the bad-seed infancy of the Soviet Union, poets have tried aerating the spaces around their verses’ lapidary sonics with imagistic tumult where syntax would otherwise hold sway. The results have more often broached the hazy, mazy subfusc of Lauterbacchanalia than anything that martyred revolutionary could have imagined. A few superb exceptions to this put-down of “overdetermining” poetics could be adduced, but passable instances of poetry that have emerged from that draught cupboard unscathed are, to say the least, few and far between. In recent times, in fact, only the finest of John Berryman’s “dream songs” and a scattering of like miracles would survive such winnowing. “26” of Berryman’s cycle most certainly does, towering over nearly all of its 384 bunkmates in having found a third way to go on giving in defiance of giving over or giving up:

                        The glories of the world struck me, made me aria, once.

                        ―What happen then, Mr. Bones?

                        if be you cares to say.

                        ―Henry. Henry became interested in women’s bodies,

                        his loins were & were the scene of stupendous achievement.

                        Stupor. Knees, dear. Pray.

 

                        All the knobs & softnesses of, my God,

                        the ducking & trouble it swarm on Henry,

                        at one time.

                        ―What happen then, Mr. Bones?

                        you seem excited-like.

                        ―Fell Henry back into the original crime: art, rime

 

                        besides a sense of others, My God, my God,

                        and a jealousy for the honour (alive) of his country,

                        what can get more odd?

                        and discontent with the thriving gangs & pride.

                        ―What happen then, Mr. Bones?

                        ―I had a most marvellous piece of luck. I died. 

Twenty years ago, in a poem titled “The War of Vaslav Nijinsky,” Frank Bidart strip-mined a like vein in order to infuse a tale of a famous Russian dancer’s homoerotic woes with much the same crackling nervous energy as drove his subject to ever more terrifying heights and depths. And yet, for all the disjunctive fragmentariness of its projection, Bidart’s “War” gives us a Nijinsky parceled—some might say “Diaghilev-ed”—out into panels of discretely choreographed prose. It may be a prose “gone ballistic,” but its electrically charged ganglia remain quite unmistakably distant from anything that could reasonably, or even unreasonably, be called “verse.” The declamatory nature of Bidart’s galvanized sideshow forbids selectively brief quotation:

                        —Even now, I can see the World

                        wheeling on its axis . . . I

 

                        shout at it—

 

                                     CEASE. CHANGE,—

                                                                         OR CEASE.

 

                        The World says right back: —

 

                        I must chop down the Tree of Life

                        to make coffins . . .

 

                        Tomorrow, I will go to Zurich—

                        to live in an asylum.

 

                        MY SOUL IS SICK, —

                                                            NOT MY MIND.

 

                        I am incurable . . . I did not

                        live long.

 

                        Death came

                        unexpectedly, —

                                                 for I wanted it to come.

 

                        Romola. Diaghilev.

 

                        . . . I HAVE EATEN THE WORLD.

 

                        My life is the expiation for my life.

 

                        Nietzsche understood me.

 

                        When he was sick, — when his SOUL

                        was sick, —

                                     he wrote that he would have

 

                        much preferred to be a Professor at Basel

 

                        than God—;

                                     but that he did not dare to carry

 

                        his egotism

                        so far as to neglect the Creation of the World. . . . . 

Even the spaciest prose can occasionally appear to successfully superintend the spasms of its own over-active brain activity, but poetry, however pixilated it might be made to seem by the intoxicants it itself secretes, most certainly cannot. Nor with equivalent feasibility can one assert that the overleaping of normal continuity by pressing language to its outermost rim of suggestiveness, whether through bypassing “ordinary usage” (whose spectral presence the “ghosts in the machine” of grammar and syntax can easily be coaxed to project) or by emotive “bangings-on-a-can,” is within verse’s generally accepted range of options.  

But there is yet another can of worms which anyone preferring poetry to all other kinds of writing must eventually come to terms with, and that is the constant tug exerted upon prose by the forms and desiderations of storytelling, as opposed to the moony fits to which the starts of poets and their creations are alike subject. Startling—and disturbing—as it might be to accept, poets do not always prefer poetry over prose as primary reading matter. James Merrill, for one, confided to interviewers that he would much rather curl up with a witty and engrossing work of fiction than run a marathon with either a real or an ersatz Pindar. “I’ve enjoyed reading novels more often—or more profoundly—than I’ve enjoyed reading poems,” he confessed in one such tête à tête. “There seems to be no poet except perhaps Dante whose work has the extraordinary richness of Tolstoy or Proust; and there are very few poets whose work gives as much fun as [Henry] James. . . . You hear a voice talking in prose, often a very delightful voice which can say all kinds of odd things. For me, to get something of that into poetry was a pleasure and even perhaps an object.” 

Merrill gloried in what he called “the waywardness of speech . . . disruptions, reversals of attitude, shifts in mid-sentence.” Not all that seldom poetry gets in the way of language doing its best to do better things within the brief time it is given to control the attention span of the endlessly distractable reader. “Too much poetry,” Merrill concludes, “sounds like side after side of modern music, the same serial twitterings, the same barnyard grunts. Just as I love multiple meanings, I try for contrasts and disruptions of tone.” Which, let’s face it, are more gracefully negotiated by great wielders of fiction than by syllable counters for whom the urge to “poeticize” outweighs a more primitive desire to see the imagination’s larder restocked with nourishing narratabilities and other materia prosaica.

### On Contemporary American Poetry

As Reviewed By:
James Rother

Howl by Allen Ginsberg. City Lights, 1996 (reprint).

   
On or about December 1955, the nature of poetry changed. Or at least in America it did, and radically too. From that point in time, as the Watergate defendants used to say, anyone who could scrape up enough money for a typewriter and a few classes in "creative writing"; had read either "Fern Hill" by Dylan Thomas or "Asphodel, that greeny flower" by W. C. Williams; and had access to someone owning someone with a press was in business as a poet.
     Consequently, out of quite literally nowhere came legions of Ginsberg and Kerouac look-alikes whose metreless confessios, wrung from obligatory stints as dishwashers, merchant seamen, and delivery boys oriented variously as to sex and mode of delivery, voiced the same Oedipal shriek as had made Howl the cri de coeur du jour among those determined to put the kibosh on Moloch's pandemonium. After decades of hectoring by Eliot and Pound it was Leaves of Grass's turn come round again, only this time the leaves on everyone's lips, being smoked as well as recited, were rather less conducive to singing the body electric, though Part III of Howl, with its by-love-possessed apostrophes to Carl Solomon, certainly essayed that proclivity also, if at a voltage level stuck between the hysterically prosaic and the Whitmanic depressive. But barbaric yawps, even following forty years of bangless whimpers, might not have aroused much interest had not these same dooryard blooms (presumably unknown to Whitman, but who can know for sure) dotted the premises of his theme park, then under reconstruction.
     Which is not to say that the more elegant line of synthetics put out by Tate, Ransom, Warren et al. were banished from the poetic scene. Far from it: the period 1956-64 ushered in what was later termed the "war of the anthologies," a display of Martial arts which, in pitting the Tweeds against the Beards & Sandals, proved, if nothing else, that if worse came to worsted, one could be Beat and fit to be tied--or boring and obscure--in more than one way; not to mention the usefulness of such rows in reminding what few readers poetry could still muster that not everyone was boycotting capitals at the beginning of every line.
               But worse was in for more than just being worsted, for the Sixties, in all their grotesquerie masked as glory, were about to burst upon the scene. Though few outside of Bob Dylan and Mario Savio would grasp fully the dimensions of what was to seize the nation in the wake of Lyndon Johnson's re-election as President in 1964, that didn't stop the majority of American poets from pressing ahead with the Popping of art on the one hand and its academic mistreatment as a kind of verbal physics on the other. The result was a miscarriage of culture on nothing less than a grand scale, full of sound and fury, signifying ripoff. That this whole grim charade should have been dignified with the label "counterculture" remains an irony whose unintentional accuracy bestrides the ensuing decade like a colossus: for whatever "culture" was disseminated in those years was passed either over or under the counter, with profits accruing to the passers well into the tens of billions of dollars.
              Oddly enough, the self-punishing compulsions of the period revealed themselves not only on the historic plane of superpower sabre-rattling and political assassination, but also on the more trivial one of mass entertainment and its offshoot, consciousness expanding. Who can fail to remember how, throughout the Johnson and Nixon years, the media and activities related to them--and which were not?--waged a piecemeal and determined assault on the human body and most of its vital functions? Dances like the Twist dismantled pelvises, op-art detached retinas, LSD and other hallucinogens attacked brain cells and chromosomes, and the transistorized jackhammer of rock music reduced a generation's eardrums to waxy pulp--all to give the assaultees the impression they existed, as though progressive amputation were the sole means by which this could be achieved. Needless to say, this climate of imbecility masquerading as liberating spirituality exerted a somewhat debilitating influence on poetry and the arts, leaving aside for the moment the cretinization of the American educational system at virtually every level, from K-12 all the way up through the imploding university graduate school. But that's perhaps as it should be. Any binge that prolonged, that irresponsible, that suicidal ought, in the retributive scheme of things, to cost plenty. The problem now, however, is dealing with the boredom ensuing from having to pay all those dues.
              And in many ways American poetry is still paying them, as though afflicted with the poverty of having too soon made Adrienne Rich. It was postmodernism, we now know, that saddled poetry--everywhere, not just in the United States--with a not-so-new breed of sensitives for whom anything left of mindful is sacred, and to whom everything but conservative values is poetically available, unless it be an ear for verbal melody, a journeyman's sense of the ironic, or the merest smidgeon of talent. I say "not-so-new" because while many of the matchups of names with facelessness have only recently become familiar, the published hallmarks of some of these ciphers have been with us for some time. Critics can talk all they like about the unprecedented smorgasbord of poets and poetry out there, the amazing diversity of styles that is everywhere to be seen, from the shores of Knopf to the graspless reaches of little mags and even more negligible 'zines, but that "diversity" is as much a critical invention as are great bleeding chunks of the poetry itself. The anger of the Beats, though having never more than approximated--Ginsberg's Howl being the one exception--the sort of rage that says to capitalism between clinched teeth, "I'm mad as hell and not going to take it anymore," has now modulated to the whining of a bunch of overfunded and underpowered collegiate post-Marxists about the utter baseness of this and the superstructural crumminess of that. And often disporting with such, in complacent tandem, are witless rehashings of all those nothing-riddled much-ados that made the work of so many university-housed poets in the Age of Eisenhower so relentlessly forgettable. A sample sonnet:

            Radioactive now, you walk beside me
            To the beach, every step a fragile
            Radiance, as if the birds had settled
            In the sun that fills your skin. To touch
            You now I need an insulated hand
            To turn aside the cobalt arrows darting
            Toward my brain. Melting sand, your soles
            Shimmer with the light of elements
            Missing from my periodic charts.

            You wade in oceans where the waves caress
            The quivering cancer afloat in light, and I
            Take your naked hand in mine, and feel
            The rays like bayonets, seagulls piercing
            My flesh, with molecules of massive cure.

This poem, titled "Lines for an Elderly Ex-Marine, in Remission," appeared recently in the twenty-sixth (and final) issue of American Review (November 1977), and it's precisely this kind of gratulatory tastelessness that will kill off a magazine of new writing every time. Clearly the poet, Larry Rubin, puts great store in C. P. Snow's warning that the humanist ignores matter scientific at his own peril. But the trouble with poems like this is that they take nothing else to heart, and the jargoneering awash in juxtaposing radioactive, cobalt, periodic charts and molecules serves only to raise the density of a gravely unspecific sentimentality to the perilous bathos of pure lead. One can but wonder what the Great Cham might have thought of this inversion of metaphysical conceit whereby homogeneous ideas are yoked by indolence together, and nature and art are ransacked for pointless illustration, comparison, and allusion. But all that's beside the point. What we're obviously meant to notice in Rubin's fourteener is--God help us--how cleverly the sonnet form's traditional concerns, love and death, are accommodated to such distinctly modern pretexts for lyricism as ex-marines and cancer. For sonnets, you see, are still eminently writeable, even if the exigencies of this era of H-bombs, neutron anti-personnel weapons and MERV's might lead a sonneteer to sing that his mistress's eyes are nowhere near as bright as a thousand suns or that the most loathsome carcinomas can be found in the sweetest breasts.
              --Which is to say that whatever spirits might be summoned up by such poeticizing are those of disembodied technique, or more properly, the atelier, and thus the point I'm at pains to make: for many poets now writing in America (and for all I know, elsewhere as well), that which gets the poem made almost always exceeds in importance the end-product which the poem-making process is supposed to serve.
     The great modernists were no less preoccupied with technique and made a feisty show of dusting off archaic forms like the villanelle, the sestina, the rondo, and the canzon. But in much of this pretentious graverobbing there persisted a faith that at the foot of the prosodic rainbow--on whose elusive spectrum the gaze of fewer and fewer current poets continues to be fixed--real gold could be found, and not of the ten-carat variety, either. Only since the facsimile edition of The Waste Land have we known, for example, just how complex structurally and prosodically was the Pounded-out version of Eliot's masterpiece. We can now fully appreciate that the formal labors of the poem, its Herculean efforts at simulating decomposition, are in some places "through composed" and in other places deliberately hidden from critics' prying eyes. And why shouldn't they be? Artistic-looking messes are easy enough to concoct, but attempting a full-dress exodus from bedlam--well, that can elicit from order certain unforeseen reprisals which put tremendous pressure on the poet to assure his readers that, contrary to appearances, formlessness masks form in his poem and not the other way around. Textual evidence supports the view that The Waste Land made its final shift from a poem of fragments to a poem of fragments about the time Pound suggested that the head note from Heart of Darkness be junked in favor of a much better one from the Satyricon, and that the title "He Do The Police in Different Voices," from Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, give way to something more in line with the newly edited version's spiritual concerns.
              Thus, what emerges from a comparison of those eventually to be deleted portions of the manuscript which Eliot diligently crafted expecting to find a home for them somewhere in his poem with those which the poem in its collaborative wisdom eventually permitted him to include is the fact that virtually none of his contrived experiments with pastiche or out-of-sync versification, such as the "Fresca" sequence in imitation of Pope, ended up making it to the printer's. The lesson he took away from this--and an invaluable one it was--was that prosody and other aspects of verse technique take care of themselves as soon as the poet realizes that what is happening in his poem lies largely beyond his capacity to determine its meaning in any conscious way, and that poetry has the greatest impact when its clarity and purpose do not too readily reveal a clarity of purpose. "Both errors," he went on to say, "tend to make [them] personal" in their poetry, a proscription which for 35 years remained in force among America's literary quarterlies, with only a small group of protesters loosely gathered around William Carlos Williams daring to go against the grain.
              Following this, in the period ushering in our own poetasting contemporaneity, came the deluge of personalizers, confessionalists, and dispensers in common language (if not always that of men) of quotidian discoveries, mundane crises, transactional graffiti. Williams no longer had a diminutive coterie of specialists in "how not to sound like a Poet" around him; he had acquired, in the years just before his death, a multitude of footstep-tracers all trying to find their variable feet. Denise Levertov, a transplanted refugee from Essexism, was among the more talented of his ephebes:

            Let's go--much as that dog goes,
            intently haphazard. The
            Mexican light on a day that
            'smells like autumn in Connecticut'
            makes iris ripples on his
            black gleaming fur--and that too
            is as one would desire--a radiance
            consorting with the dance....

         The trouble with so many of these narcissistic echoes of the MD from Rutherford was that while the good doctor had sighted new visionary shores in late works like "Asphodel, that greeny flower," his imitators were still littering the local beaches with beercans from the Collected Early Poems or the first three books of Paterson:

            On ashes of old volcanoes
            I lie dreaming
            baking
            the deathward flesh in the sun...

            And yet I rejoice
            that everything changes, that
            we go from life
            into life,

            and enter ourselves
            quaking
            like the tadpole, his time come, tumbling toward the
            slime.

         The only charitable thing that can be said for this is that it makes literary criticism no more taxing than a tea break in one of Ms. Levertov's hometown factories. Try approaching it critically as though it were some sculpted tribute to the muse of paradox instead of the chip off the Whitmanian block that it so obviously is and you will look the sort of fool who believes that a poem which carefully articulates its details is necessarily a poem about the sacredness of articulated detail tout court. No, the fruit of this poet's imagination is neither fit produce for nor any use to what Eliot years ago termed the "lemon-squeezer school" of critics, though its seedy Gibranisms ("we go from life/ into life") and pulpy ineptitudes (are basket case tadpoles typical of primal life?) offer up more than just a hint of lemon.
              We should, however, keep our historical accounts straight. Eliot's Four Quartets also attempts to stage within a world out of joint a ballet of the elements in praise of a more than earthly consort of harmonies; but Galway Kinnell's Body Rags (1968)--in which may be found the above eleven lines--merely limps from one cosmic demisé en scene to another like Coppélia impersonating Markova. Yeats is there, too: the aging Yeats whose sublime scarecrow-posture, as assumed in such poems as "Sailing to Byzantium" is even further hobbled in this poet's 1971 volume The Book of Nightmares. But that's another story; nothing much improves over a three-year span: the tattered coat upon a schtick remains, propped in the half-light of verse that dims from clumsy to falling-down illiterate. "In the Hotel of Lost Light" begins,

        In the left-
        hand sag the drunk smelling of autopsies
        dies in, my body slumped out
        into the shape of his, I watch, as he
        must have watched, a fly
        tangled in mouth-glue, whining his wings,
        concentrated wholly on
        time, time, losing his way worse
        down the downward-winding stairs, his wings
        whining for life as he shrivels
        in the gaze
        from the spider's clasped forebrains, the abstracted
        stare
        in which even the nightmare spatters out its horrors
        and dies--

        and ends,

        The foregoing scribed down
        in March, of the year Seventy,
        on my sixteenth-thousandth night of war and madness,
        in the Hotel of Lost Light, under the freeway
        which roams out into the dark
        of the moon, in the absolute spell
        of departure, and by the light
        from the joined hemispheres of the spider's eyes.

         Ah, time, time, that Great Destroyer of everything from love to spiders' clasped forebrains, which makes us lose our way worse (than what?) down the downward-winding stairs (descending Yeats?), and makes us count the nights of war and madness with the best of the Chancellors and Brinkleys. What God has wrought (and wrought up)! Of course the Vietnam War was an obscenity; it would take a shallow foppishness like William F. Buckley Jr.'s to deny just how obscene it was. But in denouncing its horror (and the depraved psychological climate which in America made such a "nightmare" feasible), Kinnell does little more than transfer atrocities from the villages of Southeast Asia onto the printed page. Yeats may very well have been right--at least in principle--when he chose to exclude war poets from his edition of the Oxford Book of English Verse on the grounds that they were too close to their subject-matter to do work of permanent importance: feelings, no matter how intense, are not art any more than gossip--to cite Gertrude Stein's scolding of Hemingway--is literature. Imagine Shakespeare's King Lear as a diary or his Sonnets as a late Elizabethan expose of a famous bi-sexual's problems in keeping his bedroom full. The possibilities involving this sort of thing are endless, but who, apart from someone like Kate Millett's subject-rhyme in verse, would bother to think about them?
              Richard Howard, noted poet, translator, and editor, that's who. Here, from his much-lauded study of no fewer than 41 contemporary American poets, Alone with America (1969), is a brief encomium on the balletic felicities of Kinnell's Body Rags

             In these poems of astonishing metamorphosis, Kinnell has been concerned to enact by his "dance of solitude" as he calls the shaman's performance in "The Bear," to articulate the truth of Goethe's great dictum: One learns nothing, but one becomes something. Ever larger in these late poems bulks or--for bulk is not what we get, but rather a flickering ballet around the circumference of what is guessed at in the darkness--breaks in upon us the awareness that in order to achieve transformation the ritual imagination of burning must in our time be abjured for natural process, with all its attendant waste and weariness: "our faces smudged with light from the fingertips of the ages."
                   

         Now, no one capable of appreciating a truly fine prose style would doubt the power, the sheer lucidity of Howard's mind or the expensive (in the literal sense) verbal instrument he wields in defense of the poetic art; but in too many of his essays one has the sense that a backbreaking effort is being expended in getting a huge artillery piece into position along a nearly vertical slope, and all that just to provide a gnat with a glorious immolation. Which is in no way intended to suggest that Howard dislikes his contemporaries or that he is more than perfunctorily critical of their efforts. Far from it: he likes almost all of the poets whose work he discusses, and is solicitously maternal toward the deficiencies his perspicuity unearths, as though--and this galls after five or six essays--he himself were partially responsible for them. It's this quality of self-enforced delusiveness that gives Alone with America the odd glint of a Dunciad done as an apologia for duncery, of a presentation for the defense following which the prosecution need only rest its case. For despite Howard's noble intentions toward his subjects, his virtually inexhaustible patience with their pratfalls, what results is one entomological Gotterdammerung after another whenever the likes of a Donald Finkel or a Carolyn Kizer finds his or her way into his benevolent sights. Thus, he can claim (with no inner- or other-directed irony that I can detect) that James Merrill's poem "Gothic Novel"--

            How rich in opportunity! Part of a wall
            Gave back a hollow sound. Forewith, intrigued,
            The Contessina knew her mind, consulted
            No one. A door! Annunziata darkly
            Swept up after the workmen and withdrew.
            Lost in thought, her mistress was already
            Rehearsing what to say in thirty years:
            'Only after our marriage did I begin
            To fear your father'--but she broke off
            And went with a candle down the dank stair
            Leading she knew not where--

         "begins with a swift pastiche of prose manners, disposed like a surrealist colonnade in an infinite regress of archness." Well, maybe; but the same could also be said (and with no less mandarin futility) of Gian Carlo Menotti's godawful libretto for the opera Vanessa, whose notoriety as camp is probably unsurpassed. If Pound's Mr. Nixon was right when he claimed that "no one knows, at sight, a masterpiece," then no one's likely to recognize "an infinite regress of archness" either, in a poem or anywhere else. While Merrill's X-ray of the gothic genre's pulpable hits may be noteworthy in certain limited respects, Howard's apologia pro vita suet is so laughably excessive as to verge on the mock-heroic. If only, one keeps thinking as one schleps through the nearly 600 pages of Alone with America, he could've found some appropriate use for all those Gallic periods and Virgilian modulations, those astonishing conceits and four-page paragraphs whose sentential labyrinths unwind like fugues in a processional composed by Leibniz and Valery--anything but having to waste good style on such effronteries to the soul as weighing smog particles in, say, Kenneth Koch's Fresh Air. This latter "rhetorical manifesto" and "screed," Howard solemnly explains,

    asserts that [the poet's] form must be come upon, must be invented (benedictus qui invenit in nomine Naturae) or risk losing interest. Hence the terrorism of many of Koch's larger, more deliberate creations which drive themselves by recipe and will to the end of their tether and ours, a final triumph of method whereby nothing can be made of them except the stunned contestation that they have been made. Such poems stand or rather loom at the edges of Koch's career like barbarous temples, brightly lighted but without a congregation to distract us from the hard brilliance of the great American monosyllables--blue, girl, ugh, fun, lunch, pants--festooning every capital, every vault; and on the altar, very reverently placed, as H. G. Wells once said of Henry James' later style, lie a dead kitten, two egg-shells and a bit of string....

              To start with, Kenneth Koch is, let it be said, a fair-to-middling aged clown who has been kicking around the Manhattan poetry circuit for over 30 years, and whose least aggravating talent is for parodying pretensions just a silly millimeter away from utter zaniness:

        Last evening we went dancing and I broke your leg.
        Forgive me. I was clumsy, and
        I wanted you here in the wards, where I am the doctor!

         An affable surrealist, Koch has managed over the years since his first book appearance in Ko, or A Season on Earth (1959) to outlive his friends (Frank O'Hara, Mark Rothko, etc.) and to influence absolutely no one. In the 1960's he drew some attention to himself as a theorist on how to get children to read and write poetry, but for the most part his career has been that of a stand-up non-sequitur who in his poems chats with the void on equal terms. All I can see looming at the edges of a career like Koch's is him ending up a perennial in one bouquet of light verse after another. To gabble on, as Howard does, about brightly lit barbarous temples when the poetry at hand accumulates pop junk faster than the back seat of a taxicab--

        Until tomorrow, then, scum floating on the surface of
        poetry! goodby for a moment, refuse that happens
        to land in poetry's boundaries!...
        Ah, but the scum is deep! Come, let us help you! and
        soon we pass into the clear blue water. Oh GOOD-
        BYE, castrati of poetry! farewell, stale pale skunky
        pentameters (the only honest English meter, gloop
        gloop!) until tomorrow, horrors! oh, farewell!
        Hello, sea! good morning, sea! hello, clarity and ex-
        citement, you great expanse of green--
        O green, beneath which all of them shall drown!--

is to mistake salami for Salome and Hearst Castle for Elsinore. But, as I suggested earlier, poor Howard can't help piling new clothes on emperors whose enterprise in walking naked owes its chic to Zachary All. His lapsus, however, is symptomatic. Afoot is a much larger conspiracy of pretense regarding the value of contemporary American poetry, and its origins may be traced, at least in part, to the dissolution of that elite corps of shock troops within the arts, that dependable company of warm-up specialists so long the bane of the bourgeoisie--the avant-garde.
              In the closing years of his life the Italian scholar Renato Poggioli (then at Harvard) tried to put together a treatise on the philosophy of vanguardism in the arts. It was eventually pieced together and translated by a student of his who titled it The Theory of the Avant-Garde and had it published in 1968. It makes interesting reading (as a corrective to Roger Shattuck's The Banquet Years, if nothing else) but what would make more interesting reading by far would be a comparably erudite study on just why the avant-garde packed up and left, leaving nothing behind but some sensationalist small change which by the mid-1960's had found its way into Hollywood's redi-reserve account, and a decade later into such novelistic door-stops as Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Where the whole roadshow went is anybody's guess; what is certain is that its vanishing is in no way attributable to the break-up of modernism, which had pretty much run its course by 1925.
              That particular vaudeville disintegrated, to quote a TLS review of Pynchon's book by Edward Mendelson, "through the working out of its own principles," a process which appears to have concluded in the late 1940's and early 1950's when works like Beckett's trilogy and Ionesco's one-acts condensed Proust, Joyce, and Pirandello to the abstract level of linoleum mosaics wired for sound and occasional shocks. But not in poetry, and definitely not in contemporary American poetry, where the last vestiges of an avant-garde dissolved in the etymological frissons of the Objectivist aesthetic: short lines, small matter, craft desiderating craft in an infinite egress of archness. From Oppen, Zukovsky, and Reznickoff to the present sprawl of Anthology City, where whole forests evaporate as though nuked in order to reprint poems whose fallout is minimal and whose half-life is a semester, virtually nothing in poetry may be said to have made new waves--unless one counts the good grey revival of the Beats with their Chanel No. 5 version of The Perfumed Garden and their litany of "America is sinking!" chanted from the decks of their chartered Titanic. So much for American poetic vanguardism from the 1930's to the death of Robert Lowell: a broken wind of howls and over-civil caesurae, a teapot with no tempests in it, not even a mild squall. And the flounder-infested mainstream of poetry and of poets? A sedate, university-regulated brook, babbling in neat prosodic stanzas, of life (both tolerable and intolerable, though more frequently the latter than the former), of love (its pointlessness and desirability), of death (its pointlessness and undesirability, though, as Leslie Fiedler has taught us, its relationship to love in America is no laughing matter). Here is the brook in a typically pensive moment:

            Talking along in this not quite prose way
            we all know it is not quite prose we speak,
            and it is time to notice the intolerable snow
            innumerably touching, before we sink.

            It is time to notice, I say, the freezing snow
            hesitating toward us from others' grey heaven;
            listen--it is falling not quite silently
            and under it still you and I are walking.

            Maybe there are trumpets in the houses we pass
            and a redbird watching from an evergreen--
            but nothing will happen until we pause
            to flame what we know, before any signal's given.

         Titled "Near," this poem is by William Stafford who, having waited until the age of forty-six to bring out his first collection of verse, West of Your City (1960), ought to have realized that striving for sublimity of thought and feeling in a style of this sort is like trying to reach Parnassus through a mineshaft. Robert Frost was adept at turning out such alum leaves or Emerson-stücke, but his perceptive readers could always tell how much of it was perma-Frost and how much just dry ice. In these ham-handed quatrains, the whole game is taken seriously, as though the poet never for a moment thought it possible that his earnestness might be judged deadly in the other sense.
              One wonders whether some of these writers ever actually read what they write anywhere but on the stage of an auditorium since their work so often displays a tin ear, along with a leaden insensitivity to anything resembling natural speech. Is it too much to ask of a poet that s/he be aware of how the specific gravity of words in various lines of verse can be altered when by their positioning they are induced to bend or lean or lean toward other words? Is it unreasonable to wonder whether anyone under the stress of vision or of understanding could ever be heard jawing a mouthful like "this intolerable snow/ innumerably touching," or committing idiomatic rape with a blunt instrument as unserviceable as "and under it still you and I are walking?"
              Yet, to pick up any major anthology of poems published since 1955 is to find hundreds of such botches springing into view. One would have to go back to the early sixteenth century in England to identify a literary period as poetically drab as the present interregnum--assuming, of course, that there are still reigns for periods to lie between. Nor are the prospects for change encouraging.
              And yet some things have changed over the years. If the Moss-covered poets of the 1940's and early 1950's hunted frantically for symbols, today's laureates hunt frantically for "occasions." An occasion, in lingo currently a la mode in the poetry casinos, is a spread of circumstance which produces in a poet a sense of verbal possibility akin to what an amateur poker player feels as he lifts that single dealt card which he's sure will fill that inside straight. However, if one reads through some of the interviews with poets which have appeared in journals like the New York Quarterly one soon discovers that the poetic excitement occasioned by these occasions is experienced exclusively as a result of the writer knowing in advance that his "inside straight" will not be filled.
              In fact, that is pretty much the point of the process: to get that string of events by which the poet is made ready for an occasion under way; and once the switch is thrown and the juice begins to flow, well, then anything becomes possible. Robert Creeley, for example, has built a successful career out of writing poetry while trying to find something to say, and others no less gifted in waiting have similarly taken the hint (and the fellowships) by learning to treat poetry as a higher form of loitering. (I wouldn't go so far in dismissing Creeley as does critic John Simon, who remarks somewhere that "There are two things to be said for Creeley's poems: they are short; they are not short enough," though there are times when I've read him and found Simon's viewpoint contagious.) Still, occasions can and do (occasionally) choose a spokesman who senses the absurdity of the whole business, who knows with intimate reflexiveness just how self-serving it all is, how much of an industry, but who nonetheless thrives on its duplicities even to the point of making them the flexible centers around which his poems take shape and cohere. Such a spokesman is John Ashbery, a huckster impresario of what have to be the most bizarrely conjured cerebralisms since that prince of Rotarians, Wallace Stevens, disappeared up the sleeve of his own Supreme Fiction in 1955.
              Alternately a tour-guide for the complacently monstrous and a ventriloquist's dummy for the very id of the Absurd, Ashbery manages in poem after poem to get not only his own shit together, but everyone else's as well:

            The buildings, piled so casually
            Behind each other, are "suggestions
            Which, while only suggestions,
            We hope you will take seriously." Off into
            The blue. Getting there is easier,
            But then we hope you will come down.
            There is a great deal on the ground today,
            Not just mud, but things of some importance,
            Too. Like, silver paint. How do you feel
            About it? And, is this a silver age?
            Yeah, I suppose so. But I keep looking at the cigarette
            Burns on the edge of the sink, left over
            From last winter. Your argument's
            Neatly beyond any paths I'm likely to take,
            Here, or when I eventually leave here.

              A number of things to note about this piece which Ashbery titled "Spring Light:" it is, to start with, a tissue of non-sequiturs, but not like those which form the collapsible spines of poems by Kenneth Koch. These are non-sequiturs which dissolve as soon as we realize we're in the presence of an interior dialogue and not something pruned from the pre-Joycean garden of Edouard Dujardin. Another thing: the poem is coordinated around a basic tone-row of terms whose axes are blue, silver (paint/age), mud (last) winter and here. As a group of terms they constitute its "occasion" to the extent that the poet, having been dealt them as a set akin to a hand of cards, must then deal with them compositionally. We're not at all distant here from some of the aleatory changes rung in music on post-Webernian serialism as an outgrowth of, among other things, the experimentalism of Cage, Xenakis, Berio, and Stockhausen over the last two decades, although what Ashbery is doing in these fifteen lines seems sufficiently word-gameish to be considered post-Wittgensteinian as well.
              Still, the idea behind it all is simple enough: like Creeley, Ashbery is interested in that frame of mind, that consciousness of language-as-a-starting-point from which all poetry emerges. But wholly unlike Creeley, he sees no need to advance from that state of mind out of which poems are generated to the essentially artificial realm where they are clad in verbal uniform and sent out into the world as performances. (Just because Creeley's word-mimes are conducted off-stage, it doesn't mean that they're not performances. To cite the most obvious example, "I Know A Man"--the object is to "act out" the habitual swerving of the mind from one psychological lane to another when, after hours at attention's wheel, it falls under the spell of the center divider.) For Ashbery--at least since his sixth book The Double Dream of Spring (1970)--poems are where they begin, and where they begin is in that luminescent zone of vanity and meticulousness before whose mirror the self primps to go out and make its impression on the world.
              It's that performative impression that Ashbery wishes above all to avoid and avoid giving, and in his poetry one finds neither the speaking masks of the great modernists nor the dramatis impersonae of the later "confessionalists." As for "meaning," its circumference is, like God in the Augustinian paradox, nowhere and its center everywhere; never, as in the early Eliot, is it made the adjunct of some ulterior voice whose dilemma seems but an excuse for the witty encoding of speech. (It is possible, for example, to read "Prufrock" as a half-sober recitation to the most intelligent bartender who ever lived.) For one thing, Ashbery has managed to banish from his poems everything that Oscar Wilde would've denounced as insufficiently extraneous, and no one who fully understands what this poet is about will lament its passing. Where significance is but the final resting place of the deleterious, themes shed their variations like vultures their feathers in a desert wind and surrealism is never more than an irregular heartbeat away:

        You can have whatever you want.
        Own it, I mean. In the sense
        Of twisting it to you, through long, spiralling afternoons.
        It has a sense beyond that meaning that was dropped there
        And left to rot. The glacier seems

        Impervious but it is all shot through
        With amethyst and the loud, distraught notes of the cuckoo.
        They say the town is coming apart.

              As several critics of Ashbery's books have remarked, it's hard to know what to say about a style like this. While from one angle such lines tend to sound like Humphrey Bogart reading a Billy Carter translation of Mallarmé, from another they come across as a collection of tether-ends in search of a mind.
              One thing that is not going on in Ashbery's poems, however, is thinking on any systematic scale. In fact, such lengthy exfoliations as "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" contain probably even less "thought" than do any of those late pseudo-meditations by Wallace Stevens with which they're often compared. Admittedly, both these poets are interested in what happens to thought when, on philosophical R & R, its allowed to roam freely among the domestic irrelevancies of the self's furnished flat. But whereas Stevens sees Poetry as promising a new religion which will in time provide America with a more enlightened spiritual capitalism than it's known in the past, Ashbery is not about to give up his Saturday nights for anything as gloopy (to quote Kenneth Koch) as either the henpecked terrestrialism of a "Sunday Morning" or the term-insured Cyrenaicism of an "Esthetique du Mal." For him, large questions are there to be begged simply because they're large, unwieldy, and finally, uninteresting; poetry, if we insist on having it, must learn to take stock of those inconsiderable quandaries which nature through the conducting of its own inventories day by day, month by month, slips into our lives:

        All things seem mention of themselves
        And the names which stem from them branch out to other referents.
        Hugely, spring exists again. The weigela does its dusty thing
        In fire-hammered air. And garbage cans are heaved against
        The railing as the tulips yawn and crack open and fall apart.
        And today is Monday...

              These are not lines, to paraphrase Eliot, which have the look of lines that are looked at; "Grand Galop," from which they were taken, traffics in no such simple narcissisms. Though the poet is here very much in his poem, it's the poem we're being encouraged to look at and not (as in, I would say, a good 90% of the poetry written in this country since 1955) the poet camouflaged by his poem, by a public gaffe masquerading as a private acte gratuit. In his verse merely as a prop among other props, Ashbery's poet flaunts no distinguishing Dasein, and it is only after reading several of his poems that we grasp the rationale for his having been trundled out onto that stage where everything is prepared for and nothing acted out, where indeed only props can speak.
              Thus, excluding certain notable differences in talent, Ashbery's work reflects some obvious affinities with that of his early New York cohorts Frank O'Hara, Kenward Elmslie, and yes, even Kenneth Koch, who seem to have taught him (in the failing wake of such Dali-esque vinyls as "Europe") that poems ought to take poets seriously and not the other way around. It was O'Hara, for example, who first abolished the "reader" in his poetry (substituting for him whichever friendly ear happened to be near any particular poem's ground zero), and showed in verse-memos like "Why I am not a Painter" (which are to conventional poetry what the clip-on tie is to the dinner jacket) that in art casualness is everything, and the more convulsive that casualness is, the better for all concerned.
              If the New York School had had a collective motto, it would have been "Unbutton me here," although O'Hara, for one, was circumspect enough to know that if a poem paraded about with its fly undone, it oughtn't to have its shirt open to the navel as well. (Though, again, this is somewhat contradicted by a remark O'Hara makes in his "Personism: A Manifesto" that "If you're going to buy a pair of pants, you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you.") Only a paid audience finds everything interesting when that everything is rolled out as a prize exhibit, and so wisdom dictates--in poetry, at least--that some things be held back: a dissimilated reticence is preferable to a simulated exhibitionism. Compare, on the other hand, the following decolletage from the boutique of James Wright:

            In the middle of my age I walked down
            Toward a cold bloom.
            I don't give a damn if you care,
            But it half-rhymes with blossom...
                ("On the Liberation of Woman," 1973)

              The refreshing thing about Ashbery as a poet is that, either as a consequence of temperament or as a matter of choice, he refuses to be programmatic about anything--not poetry, not the creative process, and certainly not the modern psyche in extremis. Not only is he conspicuously non-rebellious and non-"causal," but if his work continues to take on added dimension, he could well end up being this century's first major non-visionary poet in English. (That many would view this latter comment as pejorative with regard to Ashbery's work shows that for a large number of us, romanticism is as difficult a habit to break as three packs a day for a heavy smoker.)
              But such speculations aside, it's a genuine relief to find a poet who neither commits to his stanzas that which ought more properly be committed to an analyst's ear, nor presents himself in his poems as an aging Orestes pursued by all the Furies of the quotidian. The Blys and the Ignatows, the Dickeys and the Strands, the Kinnells and the Staffords, would do well to pay attention to this poet for whom, at this particular time at least, the only honest stance is that of nascent openness, a condition of mind akin to, yet markedly different from, Keats's "negative capability" or Yeats's self-induced openness to song. His poems advertise the awareness that in our benighted period of history, poetry has become an anachronism which attracts very little curiosity and conduces even less to love--which is partly the reason why the wit and the verbal agility of an Ashbery seem now almost redemptive in their promise of things to come. The rest of the explanation is, in my estimation, quite simple: for those who value poetry for what it can still be, the author of Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror provides the only really interesting game in town.

 

Post Scriptum (1998)

              Rereading (and, in the sense of light dusting, touching up) this piece vingt ans apres, I'm amazed at how few mixed emotions I feel as regards its essential content. In fact, I would venture the proposition that I'm more in agreement now than I was when I wrote this with T. S. Eliot's characterization of poetry as "a mug's game"--though I confess to having very mixed feelings about the utter lack of guilt that enables me to say that. Either I've become a lot more cold-blooded in twenty years or American poetry has, and cold-bloodedness is not what I, or anyone who truly values fine verse, turns to poetry expecting to find. When I first wrote "On Contemporary American Poetry," I thought I detected a certain freshness and exuberance in work done by John Ashbery which landed him in a separate and rather special category. Some of his poems from the early and mid-seventies--the ones from which the smartass smirk, that skull and crossbones of the New York School, has been erased--seemed somehow like the crowings of a Stevensian bantam, proclaiming loudly from the dungheap at sunrise that the rule of inchlings, capons, and hens was over and that henceforth there'd be no claqueing and slacking tolerated where poetry was spoken.
              Well, I was wrong. Ashbery, for all his genius grants and awards, proved no more hack-proof than the best and the rest of his generation. So, there was that correction to be made, which found me back at Square One, without so much as a glimmer of hope for an art form given its ritual burial in Paul Hoover's recent Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Sarcophagus (1994). Still, there is a new millennium looming out there, whose woof may prove worse than its warp. We'll have to wait and see if, in the bloody century almost upon us, poetry will have a more sanguine future than serious music; than graphic art and sculpture that doesn't merely do less with more computer technology and virtual unreality; than the novel, already reeling from body blows administered by pointless film effects and small screen mentalities.
          About this and related matters I have grave doubts, but you needn't rob them if you're of a more optimistic turn of mind.

          Introduction

     In October 1962, the National Poetry Festival in Washington, D.C. was treated to a lecture by Randall Jarrell, indefatigable scourge of American complacency about poets and poetry. The talk’s aim was to provide all who attended with an overview of the landscape of American verse’s last half-century, one as respectful of its less towering peaks as of the Mount McKinleys and Mount Whitneys of modernism’s golden age. In covering that landscape, Jarrell did his best to distinguish between a poetic landscape dotted with exceptional flora and fauna and one dotty with them. (Obviously, with a roster of specimens ranging from Robinson Jeffers to Marianne Moore, such scrupulosity was not only de rigueur but pressingly expedient.) Limitations of (oral) space allowed for only the most rough and ready account of the period in question, 1912-1962, and so the issue of what verse written in the next fifty years might look like was moot. No doubt Jarrell thought it less depressing not to have to take up the internecine squabbling that had marred the hopefulness reigning at the end of World War II as the Modernist beacon dimmed from brilliant down to night-light intensity. 

          As it turned out, the creative vacuum modernism left would be filled by the sprawl of a nihilizing post-modernism, but the full implications of that weren’t to become apparent until Y-2K loomed. For years, the war of anthologies had pitted narrowly trained, Genteel-Traditioned formalists against bedenimed and sandaled free-verseniks (also espousing formalism, but only as an adjunct to their own content-ism) in a Battle of the Books whose knockdowns owed more to Mack Sennett than Jonathan Swift. Suited up as crusaders, each faction claimed sole exploitation rights to the Chapel Perilous of Modernism. On one side of the burning lake were the formalists, brandishing the (true) red cross of Eliot and Auden and approaching the “wasteland” of America in the same way they approached the poem with that name—as a pack of Tarot cards laying out bad news in need of exegesis. On the other were the informalists, every bit as intransigent under the white cross of Pound and Williams and seeing America already as a wasteland (if not the wasteland par excellence) with little of use to be gained by training on its hellifics a poem not one of whose 434 lines was original. 

          The “Republocrat vs. Demoblican” differences separating the two factions, while no more suggestive of real distinctions than “One man’s jot is another man’s tittle,” actually couches a crux not unlike the stunner dropped by Walter Benjamin in the reader’s lap in the final paragraph of his famous essay, “The Work of Art in An Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936). At pains to gauge the responses of fascism and communism to the shotgun marriage of art and politics their use of mass media had helped bring about, Benjamin hoisted his dilemma onto the point of a chiasmus. Mankind’s self-alienation, he wrote, “has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the situation which Fascism is rendering aesthetic. Communism responds by politicizing art.” Jarrell, however, had no interest in such abstruse matters. The implications for poetry of trends and fashions looming over the near or long term are neither touched nor touched on in his talk. There were, in his mind at least, more important fish to fry, more niceties of judgment to be rendered critically immediate.   

         Read today in terms of our not nearly so critical standards, Jarrell’s stock-taking (which appeared in printed form in the Spring 1965 issue of Prairie Schooner) seems finicky, even curmudgeon-like. For one thing, it makes no bones of separating poets into sheep that are noteworthy and goats unworthy of being noted, at the foot of a page or anywhere else. This is not to suggest that Jarrell’s discriminations are arrogantly drawn or over the top. Even with time to waste nattering about how swell it would be if poets could be judged on the basis of what they aimed at rather than what they accomplished, he almost certainly wouldn’t have done so. His personal script called for telling it like it was, knowing that if one did that, telling it like it is would no longer be a problem. Jarrell was concerned not just with where individual poets fitted under the broad tent of American values, but with how poetry—an art form he clung to even more desperately than he did to his beloved Mozart—might best survive in an age when it was under greater assault by barbarism than at any other time in its history. 

         Having such priorities as a critic landed Jarrell not just in a class but a whole species apart from careerists and bon vivants on the poetry circuit for whom living high on the hog was not all in a day’s work, it was the day’s work. How many writing today would be honest enough to refuse to review a fellow poet they felt uncomfortable about praising, or to deny some poet the puff piece or blurb they might be grateful for themselves someday? Jarrell no doubt understood why so few of his contemporaries were willing to call the bluff of buck passers and brown-nosers in poetry criticism, the stranglehold of poets and critics determined to establish a power base for themselves and their protegés being so strong in the publishing world. Why risk ostracism with an attack on favoritism when a reputation for back scratching translated reliably into a string of grants, awards, and adjunct professorships? 

          The stated aim of “Fifty years of American Poetry,” then, was to “try not to theorize about movements and tendencies but stick to the poets and their poems.” And, true to his word, Jarrell’s commentary never once takes its eyes off the prize, which was to apportion space, not in accordance with the clout wielded by each twenty-five reputations, but with how much of critical importance—in both senses of the word “critical”—could be said about them in turn. Hence his galaxy of poets is less a constellation of fixed stars in some Ptolemaic firmament floated by the New Criticism than a slew of wavering planets in asynchronous orbit around a sun that is itself having a hard time not falling out of the sky. A Copernican himself, Jarrell was prepared to acknowledge (as many poet-critics then were not) the limitations pressing in upon his age. Rather than be fenced off from others’ enclosures (as the free-versers chose to be), or pretend his own sequestered preserve was the open range (as the stable of talking mules ventriloquized by Wilbur did), he tried to counterpoise his subjective bias with as much objectivity of judgment as he could muster. And to square that circle (knowing circles to be unsquareable) with nothing but the singular equipment he was able to bring to the business of what R. P. Blackmur famously called “the critic’s job of work.”

          That for him seriousness as well as facetiousness entered into this golden fleecing of incompatibles is amply attested to in Jarrell’s letters. When the need arose, he could make the absence of tact seem the mark of sincerity, as when his friend Robert Lowell asked him why he disapproved of the latter’s prose poem, “91 Revere Street.” (“But, it’s not poetry, Cal,” he responded.) And even when need didn’t arise, the muse of mockery could prompt an inspired aside: “One sees lots of criticism by William Carlos Williams these days, but very little by Baby Snooks; it’s an unjust world.” (A note in passing: The ability to balance a world of understatement as toppling as a disaster movie skyscraper on the point of as little juxtapositional space as is afforded by a semi-colon was a talent Jarrell shared with only one other critic writing in English: Kenneth Tynan.) But on that day in 1962 Jarrell’s purpose was very much on the serious side. He wanted his listeners to accept, more or less on faith, the principles—to him self-evident—that underlay his judgment, and why his refusal to countenance the sloppy and formless in poetry was the most principled of all.   

          Topping his prerequisites for poetic greatness was a devotion not just to technique, but to the more inclusive shapings of craft. For Jarrell, for a poet to have a distinctive style it was not enough to have coasted through a number of verse collections on idle. His or her work must have impacted American speech in ways clearly measurable to the ear, and in order to have brought off this, it had to manifest a devotion to the American language which shortchanged none of its waywardness or idiosyncrasy. Without such a devotion up and running, a poet could not possibly summon the resources necessary to nudge the nation’s imagination toward the renewal and rededication Jefferson was thinking of when he proposed a revolution for America every generation or so, just to keep the young democracy on its toes.    

          Finally, it is highly unlikely that Jarrell imagined that the next four decades of American verse could possibly match the throw-weight of a modernist MERV missile armed with the warheads of Pound, Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Williams. (Indeed, it is only very recently that the assumption of this “fabulous five” being superior to all but the literary immortals of Whitehead’s “age of genius,” the 17th Century, has been downgraded to a near certainty.) True, American verse—in the wake of Auden and with some umbrage taken at Wilbur’s perdurable shade—did reach loftier heights than pessimists lodged either in Greenwich Village or the League of Ivy could readily imagine. While no single school managed to exert hegemony over its rivals (as the modernists immediately before and just after World War I succeeded in doing), the work of prime movers and shakers like A. R. Ammons, Robert Creeley, and John Ashbery awakened American poetry to possibilities even modernist experimentalism had ignored. And even if their efforts had failed to pull refractory formalists up by the same bootstraps they had used to make themselves over in a more modern image than that of the modernists in 1912, they had still moved the agenda from the indispensability of tradition to the need for a compositional method (rather than an arsenal of forms) that could salvage Pound’s “language of gists and piths” from the torpor of word puzzles which enveloped Auden in his declining years. 

          In what follows I do not propose stepping into Jarrell’s shoes and taking up precisely where he left off. Nor do I plan to match him poet for poet. His whirlwind tour of American modernism and its aftermath (beginning with E. A. Robinson and Edgar Lee Masters and ending with Robert Lowell) rounded up all the usual suspects that usually populate such sweeps: from grizzled place-runners like Lindsay and Sandburg to triathlon specialists Frost, Pound, Eliot, Stevens, and Williams; and from hardy regulars of the Tour de France, Crane, Moore, Ransom, Cummings, and Aiken to joggers and work-out specialists Tate, Jeffers, Bishop, Warren, and Roethke. My own survey will focus on a select handful of exceptional poets, with a larger number of others thought by “industry insiders” to have contributed significantly to American poetry during the four decades under review. (Readers who have been with CPR from the beginning will recall that the first real chance to get my feet wet in this genre came with a piece I wrote for Pacific Review back in 1977, titled “On Contemporary American Poetry.”) 

          The survey will begin with a consideration of Donald Justice (b. 1925), to be followed by a shivaree centering on five poets claiming the annus mirabilis of 1926 as their year of birth: A. R. Ammons, James Merrill, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, and Frank O’Hara. The proceedings will wrap up with Mark Doty, whose birth year furnishes the cut-off point for poets eligible for this go-round, 1953. Is it coincidental that all of my start-up poets are now deceased—three of them, Ammons, Justice, and Creeley—having died within the last two years?

1965 was perhaps most notable for having been the year the Vietnam War really entered the national consciousness as something nastier and more ominous than the mere “police action” earlier U.S. administrations had insisted on calling it. Throughout America, college campuses were expanding like water balloons, having become the first resort of adolescent males avoiding the draft and a choice resort for co-eds eager to experience what marriage would soon enough shrink-wrap to a house in the suburbs with a one-car garage. As a consequence, unprecedentedly large quantities of books, both popular and “serious,” began to proliferate in grocery stores and “student centers” that in prescient anticipation of the Amazon.com. explosion, stocked anything the all-ruling 18-30 demographic might conceivably browse on impulse. Tracking surveys had begun to point insistently at an earthquake building beneath what had previously been a quiet-coursing stream bed of disposable income. True, the “baby boomer” generation had already shown a marked disinclination toward denying itself anything, even to the point of putting rock LPs ahead of food purchases. But there was something in their consumer profile that was anything but customary and it involved not what the 18-24s were reading, but how many books they took home with the intention of finishing. By the mid-‘60s, nearly every college dorm room had bricks-and-boards book shelves whose stock of paperbacks, while partially reflecting classroom use, also included titles which ranged far beyond the standard Beat conspectus of the late ‘50s. So obvious was this change in buying patterns that any marketing executive worth his salt could have seen a paradigm shift developing from a subculture of loosely affiliated young people to a youth culture with the potential of becoming the mainstream culture in a very few years. And another thing caught the collective eye of those executives: adolescents were not only purchasing books in ever larger numbers, a sizeable component of what they were buying was books of poetry. The new thing really was a New Thing, and for once in the notoriously cautious publishing world, all bets were off. 

          Hats off to the Ginsberg-Corso-Ferlinghetti explosion of the ‘50s: it had at the very least turned a whole generation of young people on to Dickinson and Whitman, the yin and yang of their poetic heritage, not to mention having made a percentage of them more than dyslexically conversant with the wisdom of the east. Yet, though fine in its way, the taste in poetry it fostered did not jibe with Jarrell’s hopes for another fifty years of, if not more of the Modernist same, then something remarkably like it in perhaps a different key and with fewer dots and dashes Morse-coding the imminent demise of art. Oddly enough, Jarrell showed very little inkling of what would drive his notion of the poetically valuable from center stage. Not a single rising star among the seven poets leading off the present survey receives so much as an honorable mention in his “Fifty Years” survey, let alone those shooting stars of the 20th Century’s second half, such as Creeley, Ashbery, and Snyder, the rise to prominence of whom during the years of the Vietnam war conferred upon on their writings something of a rock star’s mystique. 

          Contrariwise, the leading lights of Jarrell’s own generation (John Berryman, Howard Nemerov, Delmore Schwartz, W. D. Snodgrass, James Wright, Theodore Weiss, James Dickey, and Louis Simpson), though failing to make the cut did make the tail-end of his short list, space lacking to reward their chops with the sort of garnish due them. Not that it mattered much: succeeding years would see the reputations of these and others of the formalist persuasion falter and in many instances fall by the wayside, burnt-out cases of a moribund literary preference. Who these days, for example, reads Berryman, Weiss, and Dickey? Or, for that matter, Karl Shapiro, whom Jarrell, along with Wilbur and Lowell, discusses at some length, and Richard Eberhart, Eleanor Taylor, Katherine Hoskins, and Isabella Gardner whom he does not? It is instructive that, among the twelve poets singled out as major by Ralph J. Mills, Jr. in his once influential study Contemporary American Poetry (1965), only Bishop, Lowell, and Wilbur survive in the present decade’s most read anthologies, with Levertov and Sexton still clinging to the canon, but with weakening grip. The other seven candidates for whom Jarrell predicted longevity—Eberhart, Kunitz, Roethke, (William) Everson, Shapiro, Gardner, and Wright—have already sunk to the level of footnote fodder for histories of American writing on whose contents dust is ever accumulating. But the time has come to press on with other matters, and as good a place as any to start is the contribution to lock-step iambics made by the recently deceased poet, Donald Justice.

 

Donald Justice 

If you’re one of those poets who can’t write without a distinct subject to set you off—and Donald Justice (b. 1925) was one of the last relics to file himself under that rubric—then you’d better be the sort who finds subjects where others miss seeing them lying about, or be fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to live in what the Chinese call “interesting times.” Justice was not so blessed, having had to live out in spades the curse imposed on all too many contemporary poets: a career of teaching the ambitious, but often talentless, young the ropes of “creative writing.” And as if this Newcastle lacked sufficient coal of its own, a career spent in places like the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, and the University of Florida, in Gainesville (where in fact Justice served out his low security sentence at soft labor) is guaranteed to truck in a shitload more in the form of time spent searching for extracurricular holes to spend in. It also explains why as a poet he never really had much to write about. It’s no secret that the cities and towns that play host to these institutions condemn their indentured tenured to unrelenting poverty of reference, which is why the poet-prof has to rely upon his divorce, or the death of a pet dog, or a bout with cancer to provide grist for a poetic mill that used to need at least a war or a lengthy Strindbergian marriage to get off its dime. 

          Thirty years of Justice titles tell their downer of a tale all too forlornly: ”On the Death of Friends in Childhood” (a thematic twitch bordering on a tic), “Variations on a Theme by James,” “Unflushed Urinals,” “The Stray Dog in the Summerhouse,” “On a Painting by Patient B of the Independence State Hospital for the Insane,” “Ode to a Dressmaker’s Dummy,” “Memo from the Desk of X,” “Villanelle at Sundown.” The list plods on, with a sestina chalked up here and a pantoum there, but with the conclusion of the awful game itself never in any doubt: to void with dated artistry the void of Nothing Doing. Is it any wonder his favorite poet (also muse: see below) was Wallace Stevens, who, between the splendors of Harmonium (1923) and the Prosperity—Tempest-tossed—of the final few amazing poems extemporized “while leaving the room” (1954-55), gave to those near, and apparently not so dear, to him (see the Letters) the performance of a lifetime as Rotarian of supreme fictions and envoy-extraordinary from the talkier reaches of Uppur Wahoo?     

          Justice’s long anticipated Collected Poems (exactly fifty years after Stevens’s) missed narrowly at being a posthumous publication, which in a rebarbative sense seems appropriate for a poet as much addicted to time warps in verse as to broad-beam architectonics. Fond of indulging himself, as one of his own personae describes it, “in rich refusals,” Justice fell into and then anorexically clung to a prosody which others in his generation seemed not to be able to divest themselves of fast enough. His muse (though his devotees would flatly deny this) was even more conservative than Stevens’s. Thus, though it might’ve been Harmonium’s gaudy impresario that drew him on, it was the garrulousness of the Hartford poet’s seasonal zeppelins—the ones in oh-so-blank verse and sporting titles like “Transport to Summer” and “Auroras of Autumn”—that  finally lured Justice to Snoozeville. Not only were these hot-air balloons not dirigible as poems (see Randall Jarrell on this score), they were like fire retardant applied to the blaze consuming European influences Walt Whitman had done his unlevel best to start. True, a part of Justice never ceased hankering after such potted luxuriances as “Disillusionment of Ten O’Clock” greenhouses; Justice’s quite early “Song” and its 1967 follow-up, “After a Phrase Abandoned by Wallace Stevens,” make this abundantly clear: 

                        The alp at the end of the street

                        Occurs in the dreams of the town.        

                        Over burgher and shopkeeper,

                        Massive, he broods,

                        A snowy-headed father

                        Upon whose knees his children

                        No longer climb;

                        Or is reflected

                        In the cool, unruffled lakes of

                        Their minds, at evening,

                        After their day in the shops,

                        As shadow only, shapeless

                        As a wind that has stopped blowing.

 

                        Grandeur, it seems,

                        Comes down to this in the end—

                        A street of shops

                        With white shutters

                        Open for business . . . 

Even more than the fungibility of The alp at the end of the street (which here ends up non-negotiable anyway), the keeper for Justice in this snow globe of keepsakes is the delicacy of perception which, in the world as it is, as usual and without end, merits the only “Amen” worth the uttering. Growing old has its rewards which, as our respect for those “once only” experiences that make a dog’s life desirable only to a dog mounts, become more and more obvious. “Men at forty,” he wrote in the poem with that line for its title, “Learn to close softly / The doors to rooms they will not be / Coming back to.” Truth approaches on padded feet of off-rhyme and half-rhyme, of assonance glibly ensconced in its own pastel cocoon, rocking liltingly and never urgently or insistently—very much, in fact, like the age of forty itself: 

                                    At rest on a stair landing,

                                    They feel it moving

                                    Beneath them now like the deck of a ship,

                                    Though the swell is gentle. 

          It could be argued that Justice is least overextended poetically when whistling in a dark less bruising than the one blank verse whistles in, which, as anyone having read 18th-century English poems not by Pope, Swift, or Johnson knows, can, unless negotiated by the nimblest feet, produce sounds as tripping as a walker with training wheels. His iambics, when they dance at all, do so often with two left feet. If Shakespeare and Tennyson move with the easy grace of a Fred Astaire, and Milton and Wordsworth with the leggy enjambment of an Ann Miller top-hatting her own tail, Justice is, even at his Hardy-est, a Mickey Rooney flailing in double-time to keep up with Judy Garland. (Though critical, for example, of “the hard, thuddy iambic pentameter line” of Robert Lowell’s Lord Weary’s Castle, he could himself never resist the iambic heave enough to want to give it the heave-ho.) His good humor, which often emerges in Kodak moments of co-eternizing with the forgotten and neglected (“unknown poets” like Robert Boardman Vaughn and neglected senior citizens not infrequently supplied pretexts for his poems) rescues him from the dour and despondent more than once. Instinctively, he must have felt that broad expenditures of feeling encouraged an indulgence of expansiveness—read talkiness—his verse could ill afford. (The fatal attraction to rime riche, or false rhyme—repetitively growing, as did he, also—hindered him further.) Paradoxically, it was this same expansiveness which gave his otherwise limited art the legs to keep on keeping on, even when the old two-step must’ve seemed no more worth the candle than adding to the tapers lit by Wilbur and his minions to try to stem the gloom spread by the New York School’s reigning princes of darkness. 

          It’s an article of faith (mostly in the editorial offices of The New Criterion) that Justice’s verse has been unfairly attacked by those resenting the candor he has shown in reviewing the work of his peers. His poetry has been condemned—or so the conservative journals maintain—for its “lack of vitality . . . urgency . . . colour and surprise,” not to mention a “weary passivity” and “a habit of elegance which cushions meaning.” One hatchet-for-hire even went so far as to write that the poems, “formal but fatigués . . . create the impression of getting great job-satisfaction without actually doing much work.” How much justice there is in this type of criticism is of course open to debate. What is harder for this poet’s defenders to explain away, however, is the pronounced lack of musicality in the poetry of a writer who not only set out on a career of composing along the lines of his mentor, Carl Ruggles, but also kept in close contact with music and musicians (he was reputedly more than just a parlor virtuoso of Chopin) until the very end of his life. Scan his Collected Poems anywhere and you might well find, as Bruce Bawer has, “understatement . . . honest feeling, careful observation, and fresh expression”; what you will not find is the “limpid lyricism [and] gracefully flowing music” that he insists is there. The neocon prophet in the anti-academic burning bush Prophets & Professors (1995) singles out The Sunset Maker (1987) as especially redolent of these qualities, though the evidence he cites seems no less tone-deaf than much of what fills out the Collected Poems. How musical is this— 

            Two mules stand waiting in front of the brick wall of a warehouse,

                        hitched to a shabby flatbed wagon.

            Its spoked wheels resemble crude wooden flowers

                        pulled recently from a deep and stubborn mud—? 

Or this— 

                                    Turn your head. Look. The light is turning yellow.

                        The river seems enriched thereby, not to say deepened.

                                    Why this is, I’ll never be able to tell you—? 

Or, heaven help us, this, which as a length of liederhosen even Ned Rorem might think twice about scoring: 

            Busts of the great composers glimmered in niches,

                        Pale stars. Poor Mrs. Snow, who could forget her,

                        Calling the time out in that hushed falsetto?

                        (How early we begin to grasp what kitsch is!) . . . ? 

          If the unusual number of bad reviews Justice received during his career can really be laid to pay-back and get-even, The Sunset Maker is surely the wrong book with which argue the injustice of those bad notices. Ought Justice’s poems then to glimmer in posterity’s niches? Doubtful: he seems not to have known what Byronic kitsch is

 

A. R. Ammons 

Among the group of five “annus mirabilis” poets (born in 1926), A. R. Ammons (whose Collected Poems bears the scarcely believable date of 1972!) unquestionably deserves the accolade of primus inter pares. To those who feel at best lukewarm about his poetry, Ammons’s total body of work (in complimentary terms generous; in uncomplimentary, huge and unedited), having too often resorted to inquietude as a means of countering disquietude, is too much of a muchness, an overplus gratuitously piled on. To others better disposed to it—as Harold Bloom is—its towering pre-eminence over competing oeuvres leaves it virtually without rival as an American resource. Not infrequently poets with as much stuff rattling around their bibliographies as Ammons has—the final totting up is still many months away—are held to be deficient in that economy which all deserving of the name of poet must be masters of. But to write him off solely on those grounds (Jarrell’s injunction against poets who “sprawl” to the contrary notwithstanding) would be, as that Frenchman said, worse than a crime; it would be a blunder. Ammons’s compositional excess (if that’s what it is) seems more a function of his liberality and openness than the undisciplined plummet of flap-mouth into folderol. The work, which is to say that pulsing aggregate of periods and phases, of failures as well as rare moments of being “struck by lightning,” constitutes a gestalt infinitely greater than the parting of its sums by an unexacting criticism that dissects in order to murder what effectively it neither understands nor appreciates. A body of work like Ammons’s should be viewed less as a conga line of explicit gestures than a grand emulsion of perceptions, acts, and redactions—a fluid suspension which alters from poem to poem and from book to book, and thus strangles at birth, and with its own umbilical cord, the rationale on which a “Collected Poems” is built. 

          Typically, an Ammons poem is sprung from a coil of energy that regulates its flow through the release actions of colons operating like canal locks. These urge a stream of aperçus down an articulational tube whose workings are not all that different from an intestine’s. In such a composition the colon doesn’t signal the onset of a list, litany, or catalogue, but rather reactivates a metabolic control which poetry long ago surrendered to prose-hungry syntax. As a consequence of the crippling concessions made to sentential discourse by the exponents of mannerism—Gongora and Donne come most readily to mind—the process of saying (by way of eternal prospectus of logical inevitability) this . . . and this . . . , inevitably as a consequence of this  . . . , such as to ultimately give birth (via a vaginal plunge, after much labor) to that. In this way, openings onto further openings (remember the canal locks) make of parataxis and hypotaxis a single motive cell driving consciousness through conduits of perception that not only irrigate the self’s outlook on the world, but provide that self with a living model of higher rumination on the hoof. 

          The somewhat brief poem “Love Song” (1970) encapsulates the cornucopiousness of Ammons’s poetic ecosystem as well as any but his longest and most implicative compositions: 

                        Like the hills under dusk you

                        fall away from the light:

                        you deepen: the green

                        light darkens

                        and you are nearly lost:

                        only so much light as

                        stars keep

                        manifests your face:

                        the total night in

                        myself raves

                        for the light along your lips. 

          Try monkeying with the punctuation of this (which, along with everything else in the poem, is taut and logical but never tautological) and you end up not with the figurative arm and leg willingly paid for love, but a syntactic prosthesis needing a torso of explicitness to activate its motor functions. The implanting of colons in lines two, three, five and eight is as strategic as the placement of caesurae in any hendecasyllabic stretch of the Commedia of Dante’s. Various tricks are brought off here, some keyed metaphorically to antics of light the teasings of which are but a hop, skip, and a jump ahead of obscuration, others more like a painter’s fine-tuning of shadow, shade, and penumbra than the mechanics of passion loosed by an engineer of the erotic on an artificial woman; while still others are so light on their feet they resemble snatches of a nocturne scored for gossamer and thistledown. Viewed simply as poetry, how removed its effects appear from the spiky ballistics of a W. C. Williams when propelling one of his projectiles from perception to perception. Or from the Szegeti-like tropisms of a Creeley toward “notes” not exactly “off” but close enough to being so to keep the reader’s eye and ear vigilant and attentive. If Ammons’s poetry has a hallmark, it is flashfloods of IQ through gullies of rapt detail. His verse prompts the same encomium that Jarrell, in a rare relaxation of the cordon of understatement he usually maintained in such proceedings, applied to Marianne Moore: “What intelligence vibrates in the sounds, the rhythms, the pauses, in all the minute particulars that make up the body of the poem!”  

         When one remembers that the habitual Ammons subject—indeed his central theme, topos and figura—is light, this all begins to make more familiar sense. Pound devoted a career to pressing home the equivalence (found everywhere in classical myth, east-Asian folklore and medieval philosophy) of light and intelligence, natural illumination and the sacred. Be the light in question light triumphant, light oscuro, light in the form of Weltlicht suffused, or lumière dorée, whatever its variety, it ultimately bodies forth into what the poet eloquently summarizes as “radiance.” 

            When you consider the radiance, that it does not withhold

            itself but pours its abundance without selection into every

            nook and cranny not overhung or hidden; when you consider

 

            that birds’ bones make no awful noise against the light but

            lie low in the light as in a high testimony; when you consider

            the radiance, that it will look into the guiltiest

 

            swervings of the weaving heart and bear itself upon them,

            not flinching into disguise or darkening . . . 

          Illumination in a poem like “City Limits” is not just the potentia made possible by the medieval Scholastics (a cross between semi-final causality and the desire—if not quite the will—of God), but a more pervasive plenipotentia able to make light of things both within and without by returning the full range of human tactility to the biosphere (or what the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl called the “life-world”) which it never should have left. The opening to “He Held Radical Light” concretizes to the fullest extent possible the tunnel such light is visionarily at the end of: 

            He held radical light

            as music in his skull: music

            turned, as

            over ridges immanences of evening light

            rise, turned

            back over the furrows of his brain

            into the dark, shuddered,

            shot out again

            in long swaying swirls of sound: . . .  

          The most notable triumph of Ammon’s impressive poetic career was his own unique invention, the bi-linear stanza energized by a succession of colons over great stretches that can only imprecisely be termed “meditative.” Garbage (1995) and Glare (1997) remain superb exemplars of this archetypically American form of naturally heightened speech. 

          Few poets randomly quoted reveal themselves at the top of their bent, but Ammons almost always does. The strategies guiding his game, and even the exclusive patent he holds on the process by which poetry is made to seem more like a thing secreted than one wrought by hard work, are constantly on display, leaving the reader to wonder whether the awe-inspiring Ammons is the locus of a prodigy tapped or of a geniality freely released into the air:  

                        if I don’t know what it is it could

                        be anything—a slue-footed, coned,

 

                        tail-bent galligarngion: so it is

                        helpful when words pinpoint, trimming

 

                        excess: this tape is so skinny: I

                        have to crack off the lines and roll

 

                        the trimmings back into the next line:

                        there is never enough room: the

 

                        lines have to digest something, pack

                        it down, shove stuff together: my

 

                        wife has a trimmings doctrine: she

                        thinks trimming should be removed

 

                        from the premises: raked-up lawn

                        grass, leaves, dead branches, old

 

                        rose canes squirrels’ walnut nibblings: . . .

                                                                        (Glare, “49”) 

       The unself-consciousness with which this dances into our confidence and belief is nothing short of astounding. The premier physicist of our age may have taught us that light has mass, but it took an A. R. Ammons to show us, beyond even a poet’s power to relativize, how fleetly it can throw its weight around. Truly, an unworrier of tangles for the ages.

 

Robert Creeley 

Robert Creeley, whose death in 2005 joined a bumper crop of poet-Adonises recalled to the earth, was also a light-carrier, but his was a light often hidden behind a bushel where its rays remained too scrunched up and minimalist to be properly appreciated to a readership still reeling from the fireworks displays put on by Eliot, Stevens, Frost & Company. If “Sunday Morning” or “Little Gidding” is your cup of tea, the chances are that Creeley, early or late, will strike your taste buds like lemon water served tepidly over day-old mint. And yet, and yet . . . there is nothing lemony or in the least watered down about that decoction of Dickinsonian apses nominalized as “The Names.” 

            When they came near,

            the one, two, three, four,

            all five of us sat

            in the broken seat.

 

            Oh glad to see,

            oh glad to be,

            where company

            is so derived

            from sticks and stones,

            bottles and bones. 

All right, wave this away as fun and games if you like, or as mere runes or charms if you must; but there’s no dehiscing the succeedent into small matter and negligible mind, no matter how fine the diamond cutter used: 

                        There was no one there.

                        Rather I thought I saw her,

                        and named her beauty.

 

                        For that time we lived

                        all in my mind

                        with what time gives.

 

                        The substance of one

                        is not two. No thought

                        can ever come to that.

 

                        I could fashion another

                        were I to lose her.

                        Such is thought. 

          All orotundity of formal speech disappears in such decoupling of pretext from context; but kindly note how a new decorum unpredictably bubbles up, rededicated and refreshed, to occupy the space that formality abandoned. It’s as if we were watching a northern passage to the self being discovered enabling us to circumvent all that is selfish, self-centered, or self-involved, and it was all being done in a void of attendant ceremony, with nothing but an improvised kayak and becalmed horizon to steer by. Though it may not seem so (given the I-encrusted reflecting pool gracing the lion’s share of Creeleyan verse), what we are privileged to bear witness to in poems like this is nothing less than the death of self-echoing narcissism which has haunted our lyric poetry since the Renaissance first inundated England with that template for grief known as the Petrarchan sonnet. Indeed, the entire galère of neurotic interpositions and Oedipal surrogates bequeathed us by Freud is made to perish in an acid bath decanted from the retorts of lucidity allowed by Wittgenstein to be circulated as The Blue and Brown Books and Philosophical Investigations. (To Marjorie Perloff’s credit, this connection was finally taken up in her Wittgenstein’s Ladder [1996], albeit decades after the fact of this relationship should have become apparent.) 

          To properly appreciate just how subtly the language of this verse is turned, one should observe how its homologue, as found shaping Creeley’s critical prose, is handled. Still an undiscovered continent as recondite to those supposedly in the know as that most idly scorned of American books, The Recognitions by William Gaddis, the mostly occasional pieces that make up the Collected Essays (1989) give voice to what Creeley thinks in a way precisely homologous to what the grasp of what it means to be wholly alive becomes a matter of feeling in his poems. Not since Donne has a poet in English so ably met T. S. Eliot’s prerequisites for an undissociated sensibility in verse: the halting progress toward thought in a Creeley poem is indeed felt “as immediately as the odor of a rose,” though to be sure less vanity obtrudes in “For Love” than in, say, “Valediction Forbidding Mourning.” Note, too, the Wittgensteinian absolution extended by the troika of sense (sight, hearing, touch) to the sin of “meaning” in this offbeat (as well as off-Beat) chiasmus that inscribes Creeley’s poetry and prose within a single articulation framing “X”. The essays point to certain dispositions, tendencies, nodes of postulation and circumstance. What they don’t do is mean in the sense of “give aid, comfort, or logistical support to either an ongoing argument or a point of view.” And neither do the poems, which gravitate toward poles of feeling but leave the parsing of magnetic fields to iron filers and their Rorschach blots. How many poets have ever been so blithe and at the same time forthcoming when nitpicking what they do and why they bother doing it? 

There is no simple way to say anything—unless by that accident which is feeling, one is given, literally, the words in their own terms. It is here it all begins, an endlessly possible world. No one earns anything by it, nor can it be come to as an intention. What it all means is insistently more than any one sense of it will offer. Again and again it will happen, and in that demand its own occasion.

I can no longer remember what it was led me to try to write poems. I had no articulateness, and no sense of a place where such activity might be possible. But I don’t think one knows more than that one has to and/or does write as he can. . . . 

          What is miraculous is the frequency with which those palinodes of humility (without whose simultaneous back-to-front and front-to-back dioramas of possibility true imaginativeness in poetry would be scarce indeed) arise from such graven monotones over Creeley’s signature. Fully one-half of almost every utterance this least periodic of poets lets drop (its first half) has the clink of a cliché as lazily reached for as it is casually grasped. There is no simple way to say anything would remain no more than a Trappist’s pretext for maintaining silence, were it not for the revelatory torque it projects past the dash—unless by that accident which is feeling, one is given, literally, the words in their own terms. Indeed, to unpack even a few of the latencies underwriting these twenty-five words would tax the fathoming dexterity of a mine sweeper. One thing does, however, remain certain: all of Creeley’s writing is not just of a piece, but the criticism, the short stories, even his one novel, The Island (1963), all participate in an unending design that has been unfolding within his inner space since the ‘40s. If that design can be reduced to a single paradigmatic screed, it is the one adduced in the introduction to The Island:

A suspiciously simple sense of life is that it is, in any one man, conclusive. Oh, for him—of course; but for this world, I wonder, or rather think it is only in the relationships men manage, that they live at all. People try with an increasing despair to live, and to come to something, some place, or person. They want an island in which the world will be at last a place circumscribed by visible horizons. They want to love free of a continuity of roads, and other places. This island is, finally, not real, however tangible it once seemed to me. I have found that time, even if it will not offer much more than a place to die in, nonetheless carries one on, away from this or any other island. The people, too, are gone. 

          And how might admirers of Creeley’s poems set about converting the legion of infidels who never boarded the Projectivist Express and continue to decry (as in the notoriously dismissive manner of a John Simon) their apparent formlessness and anti-poetic mien? First, by stipulating in the strongest terms possible that Robert Creeley is not Charles Olson, nor Olson Creeley. Second, by stressing the inherently fluid nature of Creeleyan poetics—to wit, that not every utterance speaking its heart has been etched in stone with a marmoreal chisel. Third, by continuing to draw attention to the deep formal alliance poems like “For Love,” “Again,” “The World,” and many others forge between fresh, situationally determined speech and minutely overseen syllabics and patterns of stresses. Finally, by never ceasing to read Creeley’s best poems aloud so that disbelievers might, in the presence of the most subtly elaborated music in mid-century American poetry of any school, again be made whole. To help counter the objections sure to be made by those claiming an inability to hear that music, one might cite the critic Michael Hoffman on joys hidden away in Robert Lowell’s prose: 

. . . [Lowell’s best short prose form . . . , the free personal memoir] also manages infinitely subtle and musical sentences, like this one, again on décor: “A reproduced sketch of Leonardo’s Virgin of the Rocks balanced an engraving of Stonewall Jackson.” The balance extends further than that, though: to reproduced and virgin, rocks and stone, virgin and stonewall, and to the “o”s of Leonardo and Stonewall, and the “x”s of Rocks and Jackson.” 

          Contrary to the pronouncements of certain royalists who would thrill to see the corpse of a Ransom or a Tate, embalmed and upright on a stallion, El Cid-style, leading a renewed charge against scoffers at intelligent design, Creeley was every bit as much a formalist in his own way as Merrill, Justice, Wagoner, or Merwin. He merely responded to the exigencies bared by conscious craftsmanship in a manner different from theirs and had his ear attuned to frequencies and harmonics which lay outside their hearing. His eloquent stammer reflected his own take on the quintessentially American patois of on-the-spot phenomenology which Whitman parsed into lengthier lines and which reduces with but few refinements to the Cartesian koan: I commit myself to speech, therefore we are. But what poet doesn’t carry on as though that were indeed all we know and all we needed to know? 

          Part of the problem in staying on the same wave length as Creeley’s is that his poetry forces us, by the strange torque it brings to language, to view meaning in a different way. (Remember Eliot lecturing us in “The Metaphysical Poets” about the modern poet having “to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning”?) Take the meaning of “true,” for instance. Many critics have shipwrecked on Keats’s equating of truth and beauty at the conclusion of his famous ode and have carried the debris and detritus over to their misconception of how “modern” poetry has worked since about 1912. What is “true” within the confines of a Creeley poem does not correspond to something “being so,” or “matching up with the state of things as sensed or reasoned.” In fact, it has very little to do with the veracious or veritable, the verifiable or the veridical. What it has very much to do with are Wittgensteinian canons of “certainty” and what we mean, or used to mean, by phrases like “his aim was true” or “they were true to each other in their fashion.” Only by restricting its meaning in this way does Keats’s conflating of truth and beauty make any real sense. Hitting the target at its center, without disturbing the universal balance of energies too much with worries about aiming, approximates pretty closely to what is “true” in Creeley’s realm of poetic reference. Some, if not much, of this derives from Pound, his Confucian translations and the Mencian doctrines that permeate the later Cantos. But almost as much grew out of the association built up over years of talking to, corresponding with, and being a party to the researches of his Black Mountain colleague Olson, who opened up for Creeley the long obscured world of Mayan glyphs and the “priorities of succession & importance” that governed all process, natural as well as human.      

          Is there a downside to this poet’s informally pursued formalism? Unavoidably, there must be; whenever a poet depends on the heat of the moment to provide the glue to make the verbal filaments of that moment cohere, there are bound to be not just misses as well as hits, but over time a lot fewer hits than not-hits. Also in the negative column, Creeley allowed drafts of his work to be published that were still, quite glaringly, in the chrysalis stage, and to be quite frank, self-standing poems many of these efforts are not. That said, nearly sixty years of mature composition have left behind a highly respectable body of Creeleyana that vastly exceeds the merely respectable. Some good poems come as close to being great as our dwarfish times allow; numerous others are at the least very good; and a great many beyond that make for, at best, a fitful read. There’s an awful lot of Creeley to take down from the shelf, and to make much of the less than fine while ignoring the lot is to sound both the depths of the ungrateful and the shallows of the rude.

     Frank O’Hara, who died in a dune buggy accident on Fire Island in 1966, resembled, at least superficially, every freewheeling sandblaster for whom free verse was an instrument even more satisfying than polemical prose for sounding off about not only which aspects of ‘50s and ‘60s American culture rubbed them the wrong way, but why they were endemically and even a fortiori against the grain. In respects that count most, he was less like the other sandblasters than might’ve first appeared in early aerial photographs taken of postmodern stylistics. It is that special difference, both in kind and in degree, which lifts him above the ruck of poetry-and-jazzers who managed to upstage him until Ferlinghetti’s City Lights Books published Lunch Poems and made O’Hara’s verse-on-the-go as hip with boppers and Village types as A & W drive-ins with teenagers out for curb servicing. 

          If O’Hara’s open-shutter verse seems never to get far past skin-depth, it’s because skin deep was where this poet felt most comfortable and creative. It was also where he thought poetry, or at least his brand of it, could best most profitably pitch its tent. Tent, one is inclined to stress—not mansion, townhouse, or, heaven help us, condo. For this confirmed addict of every tremor it is possible to visit upon the epidermis of urban life, poetry was an affair of nomads and rhizomes, of drifters and grifters—the whole kitless caboodle of early and late Rimbaldians who lugged nothing from experience to experience but their own eternally randomizing selves and who preferred to travel light with nothing but the raffish joie de vivre they could muster. If Whitman sang the body electric, O’Hara rhapsodized the body neon, all incandescent and glowing as the corpus of a Manhattan whose byways he knew better (having carnalized them into strung-out lines of verse) than any poet alive, except for maybe Federico Garcia Lorca, whose 1936 wonder, Poet in New York, put its own version of verbal neon on the map. Blinking colored light quickened pathways to the cerebrum, allowing the viscera to calibrate its pulse with the throbs of the techno-pop age; plugging directly into its polychrome wonderland allowed one to wear, McLuhan-style, one’s central nervous system to the party. And it was one endless bash that the twentieth century had thrown for itself, despite the ever-present contusions of the atomic age and its cold-war hysterics. Whitman’s Manahatta had long since dissolved into good gray legend, and little was left of its passing beyond the bobbing flotage coursing between five boroughs incorporated just after the poet’s own leave-taking in 1897, and the furtive beckonings of its ever-insistent erotic passacaille. 

          For postwar America, the heightened electricity of New York exemplified a wholly new time, if not indeed a new age with an unprecedented passion for urgency; and in O’Hara’s corner of it, even when the blood pressure of his poems slackened, they still could not avoid conveying the sense of being “meditations in an emergency” (his title, his ICU-slanted phrase). Today’s denizen of Manahatta, O’Hara was wont to think, lets contact with the city—his city, New York City—frazzle him like a finger in a live socket. If he’s a true poet, that is. An urban scop of this kind would invite the body electric to sing him, and with a sufficient yawp of current as to leave the unwary poetaster as charred as jerky and as freebased as liquid crack. In such a high and bi-wired state one becomes the electricity that one conducts, the poetic state subsisting in what—being none too safely grounded by human relationships—it can draw down to itself in the way of bolts from the blue. If there is the risk of opening oneself to disgrace whenever the hardcore circumstantial is welcomed into one’s life, there is the less likely but not to be ruled out beneficence of being graced with handfuls of poems falling into one’s lap, unbidden and unexpected. A persistent piece of gossip has it that O’Hara took down many of the poems that notoriously crammed themselves into his head not just on his lunch hour (that is already well known), but on typewriters he would “try out” in retail stores. To live, he strongly believed, is to converse—even if what one is laboring to have intercourse with is, so to speak, vocally challenged, like the heavenly orb warming his favorite retreat in the poem “A True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island.” “I know you love Manhattan,” he reassures the solar system’s most resplendent fireball, but “you ought to look up more often.” Like the chutzpah-ridden monologue O’Hara intended it to be, the poem culminates in a litany of desiderata (offered ad libitum and in the style of the good Walt in one of his more expansive moods) which add up to the regards he would like to give not just to Broadway but to Fifth, Madison, and all the other tributaries of dreams feeding into a milky way which, by the poet’s time, had morphed into a thoroughfare less great and white than overlit and under-janitored. As for life’s pressing “do”s that even the plexus of the solar system could feel strengthened by, O’Hara includes enough heartening prescriptions to provision an Exulting for Dummies even the most inept pursuer of happiness would find uplifting:           

                                                            And     

always embrace things, people earth

            sky stars, as I do, freely and with

            the appropriate sense of space. That

            is your inclination, known in the heavens

            and you should follow it to hell, if

            necessary, which I doubt. . . .

O’Hara’s “best poems tend to be the ones that might seem jumbled and aleatory but are in reality, as one critic puts it, “actually . . . quite tough, pretty organized and very difficult to imitate successfully.” His singular “discovery—apart from the paratactic sentences,” he discerns, was the simultaneous or double subject of himself and New York City. That was what he came out from behind his carapace to write: the poetry of the open-eyed, open-minded, open-hearted urbanite; cheerful diversions; the protocols of a consciousness as quick and dazzling, unpredictable and unconnected as neon lights and street noise and traffic. His lunchtime ganderings seem to convert time—and many of the poems give the time—straightforwardly into objects, stimuli, electrical pulses of thought. As [John] Ashbery says, he had  “a concept of the poem as a chronicle of the creative act which produced it . . . .”

          Hence it is hardly fair to conclude that O’Hara’s oeuvre as a whole adds up to less than the adequacy of its far-flung parts subtends; or to believe that all he should be valued for today is his moderating influence on the neo-Dada-ites who limped after him into the Informalist Follies of ‘80s and ‘90s. Without his recursive passions for free-flowing talk and “sister arts” eclecticism embracing the avant-garde art movements of the ‘50s and ‘60s, the New York School achieving a cohesive identity would be barely imaginable. Yet, as Gertrude Stein was quick to remind Hemingway, gossip is not literature; and a lot of O’Hara is, one must admit, blabbermouthing of the most compulsively loose-lipped sort that gives vent to voices that are not unlike transients cadging rides inside his own head. (Exhibit A—though an entire alphabet of examples could easily be assembled: the pseudo-“Biotherm”: “For the Chinese New Year & for Bill Berkson.”) 

          Not that creative schizophrenia is the least useful device for jump-starting a verse medium which, at a time like the mid-to-late ‘50s, with W. C. Williams’s Paterson wearing down and Olson’s Maximus wearing on, plainly required re-energizing if not along the lines of a howling Ginsberg, then at least of the sort the vers highly libre of a Ponge, Follain, Guillevec, Frénaud, Bonnefoy, du Bouchet, Roche, or a Pleynet brought to a French tradition force-fed for years on weak-kneed Cocteau and heavily fortified Sartre. The problem with running off at the mouth in the rather uneven manner of all of the above lies in keeping a vulgarity at bay which threatens to overflow its Louis Quinze spillway and spew surréaliste sewage every which way and loose. If the American Projectivists’ chief flaw was to show how easily the poem with its “face still forming” could fall out of sync with its own flywheels, O’Hara, a rebel sans causerie beyond making sure a supply of Disque Bleus and Gauloises (to which he was hopelessly addicted) kept coming his way from Paris, most assuredly did not. Perhaps he should have: if there was anything be said for vulgarity in poetry, it would have been said by now and with a greater lien on permanence than is to be found in all but that handful of instances in which this inveterate transcriber of frissons is not tempted to confuse spontaneity with coarseness of outpouring. 

          But what a handful of instances those are! From Poems Retrieved (1977): “To John Ashbery on Szymanowski’s Birthday,” “Tchaikovskiana”; and from the Collected Poems ( 1971): “Biotherm,” “Steps,” “Hötel Transylvanie,” Poem (“Khrushchev is coming on the right day!”), “Joe’s Jacket,” “Ode to Michael Goldberg (‘s Birth and Other Births),” “To the Film Industry in Crisis,” “The Day Lady Died”—maybe there are more than just a handful. But faced with the sheer bulk of everything else, the not so good and plenty of the collected and barely collected verse that make up the whole of this poet’s work, how difficult it is for even the most forgiving to keep from sighing, “O tempora, O mores . . . O’Hara.” No doubt, the slot of poet-suicide manqué à la James Dean had to fall to someone in the New York circle. It’s just a pity that someone else out of Padgett and Shapiro’s Anthology of New York Poets (1970) couldn’t have been found to do the honors. No doubt that dying as he did, O’Hara’s reputation acquired a cult status that did neither it nor the poetry it rubbed off on any good. He deserved better: he was more gifted than his celebrants took him for and not nearly as good as his detractors had to make him seem in order to make their undermining of his seriousness appear credible. Both sides of that destructive argument had their work cut out for them, for O’Hara only really drew near to greatness when he was able to escape the slapdash predictability of the avant-garde and enter the magic circle of performance art unencumbered by “happenings” or anything by which the genuinely extempore might be blighted. He was best at all this unaccompanied by all but his not-so-secret sharer and partner in everything but crime, Bill Berkson. Which drops us at the door of the final “no doubt” in this piquant and pared-down paradigm that must suffice here as the life and times of Frank O’Hara. Dying when he did, American poetry missed having a slew of New York pre-schoolers potty-trained comme il faut by the most singular talent of that galère outside—of course—of the Magister Ludi himself, John Ashbery. 

 

James Merrill

[James Merrill, also born in 1926, is a poet whose Collected Poems I discussed at length in a review published in CPR several years ago. I shall therefore restrict my comments on his contribution to a few buttery obfuscations in my earlier overview which, for one reason or another, I never quite got around to clarifying.] 

It is among the great unsolved mysteries of late 20th Century American poetry, a) how James Merrill managed to snatch the post-Audenian mantle of Most Clever Poet away from so Odyssean a wielder of witty devices as Richard Wilbur, and b) how he avoided becoming the gay pre-eminence of the predominantly gay New York school of ex- and omnipresent temporizers.  

          By the mid-‘50s, the ducks necessary for this to have happened were all dutifully lining up on either side of the Atlantic. The only thing lacking to convert daydream to fait accompli was a public swearing of fealty to the gods of abstract expressionism by this heir to several fortunes, a hurdle which could have been surmounted by a perfunctory nod given in the direction of that art movement’s two reigning mountain kings, Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg. Had such come to pass, orthodox no less than fellow-traveling avant-gardists could have exulted to see the gem-encrusted poem à la Eliot, in whose mysterium (sans Christian overlay) Merrill was a notable adept, first consecrated and then elevated as host in a ritual through whose offices the faithful could consume the veritable body of action painting while absorbing the heilige geist of post-Symbolist art, and without so much as a soupçon of heresy’s risk to their affiliations.  

          But such was not to be—indeed, could not be—given the indifference shown by Merrill to all but the most old-world accommodations markedly unobtainable at either of his American pieds à terre in New York and Connecticut. No poet unable to claim New York as his hub of operations could ever hope to be esteemed the doyen of a New York School, though Merrill largely obviated the force of that question by becoming (with shatteringly quiet resolve) the anti-Stevens of the School’s coterie or maverick wing. If in his most productive years (1919-42) the maître who gave the world Harmonium (1923) and Parts of a World (1942) never traveled to Europe, the wraith-like author of Water Street (1962), Nights and Days (1966), and The Fire Screen (1969) kept America the site of occasional visitations rather than one extendedly visited. For Merrill, any place beyond the call-waiting zone of sirens urging him back to Paris, Rome, or the islands of the Peloponese was subject to Circean layovers with swinish indulgences less conducive to furthering works-in-progress than to hedonistic running in place. Hence the mises-en-scène providing poems like “Violent Pastoral” with laminated and sunstruck hues and tones not to be encountered in the soumises-en scène peculiar to Ashbery’s or O’Hara’s poetic trysts with New York—

                        Against a thunderhead’s

                        Blue marble, the eagle

                        Mounts with the lamb in his clutch:

                        Two wings, four hooves,

 

                        One pulse pounding, pounding,

                        So little time being given

                        To feel the earth shrunken,

                        Gong-tilt of waters,

                       

                        To be at once helplessly

                        Aching talon and bleating

                        Weight, both,

                        Lest the pact break . . .  

          Their city might testify to the cleverness with which neutered violence could be gerrymandered, but not even hazards posed to joggers by Central Park can overtop the tooth-and-claw austerities undercutting Merrill’s itinerant pastorale. Where his eclogues draw closest to the New York School’s Alexandrian extravaganzas—and numerous commentators have adverted to this—is in the ratio they maintain between pure style and borderline-impure content (if the last is defined as whatever mere style superintends short of total subordination, as say in the control exerted by a dominatrix with a john): that is, to the tune of about 90%-10%. 

          Setting is mostly all that “happens” in Merrill poems, the reader having to content himself with drama forgone, forsworn, and with the wave of an unforgiving hand, forgotten. Their piecemeal chromatics dither in and out of pastel trances that lack either a Delacroix’s canvas-stalled heroics or an Ingres’s odalisquerie to give them even muted color. Typically, Merrill’s archness will swallows the meager content of one of his poems whole, relishing what is thus engorged like an anaconda—albeit one having made it through finishing school. As a poet he savors the banquet more than the individual serving of exquisite delicacies doubling also as eye candy. Inducing the slovenliness of brute experience to surround the hill of neatly ranged iambics might always present him with an attractive challenge, but it is one as dicey as betting that the man-eaters in your cage, and flashing your diamonds, will remember correctly who their best friend really is. (The grisly slip-up making news in Las Vegas some years ago merely proved what the smart money always knew in its heart of hearts: that what is up for grabs in acts like Siegfried and Roy’s is no further away the fresh meat represented by Siegfried and Roy themselves.) One would think that coercing the formidable felines of verse to lie down would be reward enough for a poet for whom the act of getting poems up and purring seldom involved more than subjecting the porch swing of surmise to gentle waftings of desire. “16.ix.65” demonstrates how accurate this estimation of Merrill’s effort level is:

                        Summer’s last half moon waning high

                        Dims and curdles. Up before the bees

                        On our friend’s birthday, we have left him

                        To wake in their floating maze.

 

                        Light downward strokes of yellow, green, and rust

                        Render the almond grove. Trunk after trunk

                        Tries to get right, in charcoal,

                        The donkey’s artless contraposto.

 

                        Sunrise. On the beach

                        Two turkey gentlemen, heads shaven blue

                        Above dry silk kimonos sashed with swords,

                        Treat us to a Kabuki interlude.

 

                        The tiny fish risen excitedly

                        Through absolute transparence

                        Lie in the boat, gasping and fanning themselves

                        As if the day were warmer than the sea. . . .  

          No one can gainsay the gleaming verbal facility stacking up food for contemplation if not really deep thought displayed here. But antipasto of this kind is primarily useful in titillating the appetite, not as anything that sticks to the ribs. Like the proverbial bluebottle buzzing exquisitely in the sun, such elaborately tricked out decadence may wink and wink and wallow in its winking, but its signal effects vanish in a wink as well, its flirty come-on revealed as no more than a show of smoke and mirrors designed to lure rubes into the tent. With our composure thus wrenched askance, we notice what is not so pleasant to observe: the delight taken in marking the death-throes of what will round out an evening’s main course of almondine on which the poet and his guests—fellow decadents all—are ultimately to dine. The bourgeois contempt (streaked with envy) with which we bristle at such delectations better left to a sultan’s (rather than a carny’s) tent amplifies the poet’s egotism as much as ours—especially as it dawns on us that the sense of entitlement the poem directs us to identify with is the poet’s and not our own. (There are of course precedents for salting the mines of irony that way: similar changes rung on schadenfreude may be detected on almost every other page of such “underground” classics as the Satyricon of Petronius.) The traces of that contempt, however, elude all summary description, and so a maggoty glow radiates from the prideful delicacy (or is it delicate pride?) with which Merrill baits the reader with a rictus-faced facsimile of his own vanity.  

          Yet, to be truly honest—with ourselves, if with no one else—who could deny the disappointment and even dismay felt scanning that appalling waste of time and talent The Changing Light at Sandover (1992)? Morsels, even of such highly privatized and arcanely cerebral rococo as comprise that mostly flyblown jeu d’esprit of Merrill’s middle life, can be diverting, to be sure. But is there really anything to be gained by devoting hundreds of pages to convince readers they’re sitting SAT exams all over again or qualifying for a black belt in MENSA? Merrill’s poetry, despite how good it often is, often leaves wondering, along with the questioner in the perhaps over-candid “Clearing the Title,”

                        What happens next? Behind the latticework

                        Of deeds no one has time or patience to undo

                        We cultivate our little lot, meanwhile

                        Waiting companionably for kingdom come?  

How companionable this wait will be is of course dependent upon just whose kingdom’s come is being anticipated. And one man’s “little” (as a poet perspicacious and keen of wit as Merrill need hardly be reminded) is not always parsable as another man’s “lot.” We don’t all thunder to the promptings of one herd, no matter how green the grazing.  

 

Allen Ginsberg 

[Were there space to accord each of them coverage, W. D. Snodgrass, David Wagoner, and Robert Bly, also born in 1926, would also be part of this discussion. But since there isn’t, I will tie off this group of poets with the only American figure to have achieved true celebrity status in the last half-century, that satura of sutras and hybrid clone of P. T. Barnum and Merlin, that howler of a bodhisattva and most hirsute muse of public undress, Allen Ginsberg.]            

Anyone reading the lead-off piece in Allen Ginsberg’s Collected Poems (1984) about the time it was actually written—Spring 1947—would have experienced in “In Society” a foretaste of not just the recreational vehicle driving the Ginsberg traveling circus to come, but its decreational tenor as well:

                        I walked into the cocktail party

                        room and found three or four queers

                        talking together in queertalk.

                        I tried to be friendly but heard

                        myself talking to one in hiptalk.

                        “I’m glad to see you,” he said, and

                        looked away. “Hmn,” I mused. The room

                        was small and had a double-decker

                        bed in it, and cooking apparatus:

                        icebox, cabinet, toasters, stove;

                        the hosts seemed to live with room

                        enough only for cooking and sleeping.

                        My remark on this score was under-

                        stood but not appreciated. I was

                        offered refreshments, which I accepted.

                        I ate a sandwich of pure meat; an

                        enormous sandwich of human flesh,

                        I noticed, while I was chewing on it,

                        It also included a dirty asshole. . . .  

          Two things are notable about this swatch of anything but blank verse: the civilized—even overcivilized—tone it affects, and the absence of the drum-like trochaics that would later characterize the “platinum hit” phase of Ginsberg’s career that enshrined within the hippie imagination such hyper-bardic effusions as Howl, Kaddish, and “Wichita Vortex Sutra.” These downbeat-first hallmarks of what would later emerge as a Kit Smart revival contributed mightily to the Poundian risorgimento that overtook American poetry after World War II by burrowing deeper into the soft underbelly of Parnassian neo-formalism than any poet had gone since Pound’s own Vorticist contretemps with the Georgian muse in England circa 1915. With every fresh twist of the “open-form” Projectivist blade wielded by the (largely Olsonite) free-versers of the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, the grave of poets certain of Edgar Bowers’s approval was more securely dug. Moreover, a different sort of torque was added by the practitioners of a type of irrealism that  claimed association with veritable Surréalisme and an American pedigree that went back as far as Robert M. Coates, the author of a much talked about (but now almost never read) cult novel, The Eater of Darkness (1926). (Note: If you want the genuine article in American surrealism, read Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood. Almost everything else published in that “vein” after 1960 is not surrealist but either anti-realist or irrealist tout court.) 

          As a trenchant slice of satire, “In Society” is very much in as well as of its time, and it anticipates in many ways (not all of which redolent of Burroughs’s Naked Lunch) the primal-scream warhorses that fueled Martin Esslin’s Theater of the Absurd. Ionesco’s La Cantatrice chauve hovers over all such “picnicking in the bank,” as does the Arrabal-esque Ping Pong by Arthur Adamov. Given its more venerable provenance, however, it also calls to mind the Latin root of “satire,” which is satura, or “bowl of mixed fruit.” (The goose which that is sauce for is still some distance away from uniting with its gander, so patience is urged.) Ginsberg was soon to seize upon “In Society”’s motif of the animal body metonymized to its orifices and run with it, to Arrabal’s bank and beyond, without ever looking back. Doubtless he was able to convince himself that what opened out to him as rectal epiphany in that poem was no mere butt plug of alienation but the entire anus mundi, in all its gross-out and bourgeois-épater-ing glory. 

          Nothing is served by re-rehearsing here Ginsberg’s rise to Beatification; the erstwhile saga of his over-publicized guru-dom; his on-again, off-again road show involving Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, the two alter-ids of his literary life who rose to volubility in the mindless absence and then the death of one parent (his mother, Naomi) and the absent-mindedness of his poet-Other (his father, Louis); the juncture at brain and groin shared with long-time lover and collaborator, Peter Orlovsky; or the self-rolled Bhagavad-Gitânes that still, even after his death, droop, Belmondo-style, from the lips of hacks laboring to keep the sweatshop of his legend alive for succeeding generations. We need here to be concerned only with Ginsberg’s reign as Maharishi of a (sizeable) wing of that squadron of transcendentally meditative and upscale leftists, a number of whom would later desert him for another, rather less greatful deadhead, Jerry Garcia. It was in the bosom of this groundswell that, following the final fragmenting of the Beat phenomenon loosely coincidental with the onset of the “police action” in Vietnam, Ginsberg found both a comfortable sinecure and a home for his burgeoning ecological concern for the mothership Earth.  

          To pursue a sidelight of this history for just a moment, one of the things that emerge most strikingly about Ginsberg and his all-too-gratis persona is the unconventional extremity of the poetry he wrote and the sort of gayness he came to embrace. True, a number of American poets, emboldened by the breakthrough at Stonewall in 1966, have departed the closet and assumed a place in the flatland that is public American culture not as poets of gayness, but as poets who in step with others shaped by differing ethnicities and genders happen to be homosexual. But Ginsberg was never by choice of their sodality; for having once declared himself in Howl and other pronunciamentos to be not merely gay but outrageously so, he ceased to be accepting of any but the most unequivocal forms of non-heterosexual demeanor. He had in every waking moment to be more than just out, he had to be out-there out—or, in his own self-description, a “pansy” who by intrepid example would lead the shrinking violets of American queerdom into the sunlight of full acceptance and unapologetic pride. None of this of course had much to do with poetry, and as might be inferred from the numerous give-and-take sessions he shrewdly stage-managed with the media (see David Carter’s collection, Spontaneous Mind: Selected Interviews: 1958-1996 [2001]), Ginsberg himself was never himself persuaded that much of this sort of proselytizing was of any real value. Nor did the Gay Liberation movement ever become convinced that having him as an “out-there” sponsor of its cause was really in its interest. Consequently, it now seems likely that the eventual outcome of Ginsberg’s many decades in the public eye will be fame not for having pioneered the visionary and prophetic “Smart-bomb” poetics of the hippie generation, but for having inspired the gay movement’s leaders to cease being Camp-followers of Susan Sontag and to come out in force against the imperialist ventures of a gay-bashing America in south-east Asia and elsewhere. (Whether either Blake or Whitman would have approved his way of respiritualizing the country, or his manner of engaging the youth culture of the ‘60s and ‘70s to hammer the America caught in his tongs, is of course another matter.)  

          For if truth be told, there is much in Ginsberg’s liberty bell-chiming that rings false, just as there was much in his endless OM-ming that, even granting the best of intentions, had less of the Tibetan monk about it than Dirty Old Man character Arte Johnson played on The Laugh-in. “How campy,” his detractors have long chorused, “was all that ranting in faux-Biblicalese about the perfidy of American militarism. How like those imitators of Gandhi who body-slammed an already reeling British Raj it all seems. It is one thing to lash out at an unpopular war tearing the only country that one has apart; it might even be necessary at certain times to do that. But to bounce one’s celebrity as the most photographed and interviewed passive-aggressive Buddhist this side of Calcutta off a wacky and plainly grandstanding ploy like trying to levitate the Pentagon in 1967, is quite another. Such behavior is not just unbecoming to a major poet, it suggests, and rather strongly that the figure in question was not altogether all together.  

          Few, it should be said, would seriously maintain that Ginsberg was an indictable co-conspirator in that absurd stunt, let alone one with sangfroid to spare. Still, it cannot readily be denied that what he did before the Pentagon (and repeatedly afterwards) does look suspiciously like the very sort of thing that many assumed (fueled by repeated assurances from him) he would never do. Whatever truth lies least, this poet’s Guevara-like mystique remains the bong of choice for a whole lot more people than ‘60s holdovers who can’t accept an expiration date on their adolescence, though the moths to his eternal flame nearly always fall into two very different categories. First, there are his fans, who can no more see evidence of crowd manipulation and hypocrisy in the behavior of their hero than the Never-neverlanders lining up behind the King of Pop can see the face of Captain Hook leering at them from under the mask of Peter Pan; and second, the no less fanatical skeptics of his legend who, if asked to associate him with one or another of history’s fabricating Blakes, would, without so much as a thought, align him with Robert rather than William. Put-downs (like Bruce Bawer’s in the essay “The Phenomenon of Allen Ginsberg”) put in a neat sack just what raises all those hackles when the name of Howl’s author invades polite conversation:

. . . Television and Nazi gas chambers, the mass media and Stalin’s gulags: to Ginsberg, as far as one can tell, they are all equally horrible. He makes no distinctions at all—he is just against, against, against—and this is a significant failing, for perceptive, sensitive distinctions are the basis for all intelligent discourse and all worthwhile art. Such catalogue poems as “Capitol Air” and “Yes and It’s Hopeless” and “Birdbrain!” lump the unpleasant in with the evil, like various phenomena of American popular culture with some of the more hateful manifestations of Soviet totalitarianism. . .

          While there may be a smidgeon of validity to some of these charges, only a critic like Bawer could revel in reducing all of Ginsberg to the rubble of hyperbole and flimflam. In fact, much of what was put between covers by this flimflamming hyperbolist is a good deal better than that, and some of it, give or take an angle labored over to make this or that blemish appear minor, even quite good. Often, the prevailing formula of Howl, bastardized to a generic, yields its house brand of unassailable rubbish; but on those rare occasions when the poet (and not his bladerunning replicant, the “poet”) is of a mind to spurn the heretofore with heretofortitude, his dumpster can surprise you with throwaway lines that are in every superior to other poets’ much cited keepers:

                        In bed on my green purple pink

                            yellow orange bolivian blanket,

                        the clock tick, my back against the wall

                        —staring into black circled eyes magician

                            man’s bearded glance & story

                        the kitchen spun in a wheel of vertigo,

                        the eye in the center of the moving

                                       mandala—the

                                       eye in the hand

                                       the eye in the asshole

                                       serpent eating or

                                                vomiting its tail

                        —the blank air a solid wall revolving

                            around my retina—

                        The wheel of jewels and fire I saw moving

                                       vaster than my head in Peru

                            Band circling in band and a black

                                       hole of Calcutta thru which

                                                 I stared at my Atman

                                                            Without a body—  

          All right, this is relatively unspoiled Ginsberg—the dumpster being datelined “NY January 1961” and not some month in 1975. Even so, “Journal Night Thoughts” shows what howlers he could restrain himself from committing when letting the kaleidoscope taken for a spin speak for itself with only minimal prompting from the peanut gallery he almost always declaimed from when the political stakes seemed high enough to warrant putting the thing on speaker phone. And yes, it is possible to be stunned, to stupefaction and even beyond, “by the oversimplification, the repetition, the self-indulgence, the egocentrism [and] utter inability to develop a theme” of many poems in the fire engine-red omnibus that hit the bookstores in 1984. But has any poet since Rimbaud had the knack of transposing into the people’s key of C psychedelia out of The Ticket That Exploded, and been able to reconstitute at will the pallor of a Laforguean moonwalk—digitally enhanced, no less—with the animated grace of “Spring Fashions”—

                        Full moon over the shopping mall—

                                    in a display window’s silent light

                        the naked mannequin observes her fingernails . . .  

Only Allen Ginsberg has. How dopey is that?  

 

John Ashbery 

John Ashbery (b. 1927), who has published his twenty-fifth book of new poems this year, is a very different show horse from Allen Ginsberg: a Lipizzaner and not a Clydesdale, for one thing, which means that his forte is the weaving of an elaborate filigree of high prances rather than stepping high toward reaches where less angelheaded hipsters would fear to tread. Like the Oz wizard of “Wichita Vortex Sutra,” he too has endured his share of knocks, mostly for being the Doctor Evil behind the “stop making sense” approach to poetry credited—if that’s the right word—with having undermined the return to “strong measures” after its meltdown in the ‘60s. For a relatively thick slice of time—his first book, Some Trees, is now a half-century old—Ashbery has been far more famous for being infamous than for having sent aloft some of the most ravishing verbal music since Whitman and Stevens nudged the self-indulgent crock-poem toward palaver more like soul-messaging than blog-rolling. Much of that ravishment continues to work its spell on a present shaped by such plinths of Ashberian blithe reckoning as Three Poems (1972), Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror (1975), and Flow Chart (1991), works that no doubt tickled the ear of the same dingbat muse for whom “Song of Myself,” “The Auroras of Autumn,” and the late Guy Davenport’s Flowers and Leaves: A Long Poem seemed not monstrosities but prodigies of a nature whose sense of scale owed more to mannerism than to the economy of means. Sung in the shadow of his mother’s death (and probably the only verse elixir to have distilled more quintessence from prolixity than Sidney’s Astrophel and Stella), Ashbery’s lengthy meditation on mortality with the unprepossessing title of Flow Chart joins comparable works such as A. R. Ammons Glare (1997) in proposing how best to manage the problem of shrinking liquidity in the redi-reserve account of American culture. Manipulating the system of interlocking conduits linking the sluices and aqueducts that remain open to outsized poems having abandoned the epic modernism of Paterson and The Cantos, works like Flow Chart access large but still portable bundles of that liquidity in such a way as to cover ground inaccessible to either belles-lettristic prose or notational verse medleys like Zukofsky’s inimitable “A.”  

          As with Ginsberg, the Ashbery phenomenon has long been a bipolar one. Our most valuable poet, his devotees insist. No, not valuable, his detractors shoot back, voluble—in fact, worse than voluble—garrulous, and to a fault he is wont to lay at the door of the previous century’s poetry rather than his own. That said, Ashbery can nonetheless boast that, these days, even his cupholders runneth over, a state of affairs that cuts bilaterally since in recent collections like Where Shall I Wander, there is much wheel-spinning in ruts so trenchant that hope of finding further traction in them seems at best quixotic. Notorious for having spun poem after poem out of what Denis Donoghue has aptly termed “chronic reverie,” Ashbery has made routinized cataplexy as rare in American poetry as popcorn ceilings in new California tract houses. When his current is fully switched on (which, self-echoings aside, it still more often is than not), he can whip out that Flentrop organ of his and make all but the most inveterate disbelievers feel wired by the sheer bravura of the instrument being stroked. In “At the Inn,” to cite but one example, he engages the late spareness of the Stevensian end game in order to speak with posthumous-like grace of a winged and wingy life which, though having flown the coop, has never really gone away:

                        It was me here. Though. And whether this

                        Be rebus or me now, the way the grass is planted—

                        Red stretching far out to the horizon—

                        Surely prevails now. I shall return in the dark and be seen,

 

                        Be led to my own room by well-intentioned hands,

                        Placed in a box with a lid whose underside is dark

                        So as to grow, and shall grow

                        Taller than the plumes out on the ocean,

 

                        Granting historically. And shall see

                        The end of much learning, and other things

                        Out of control and it ends too soon, before hanging up.

                        So, laying his cheek against the dresser’s wooden one,

 

                        He died making up stories, the ones

                        Not every child wanted to listen to.

                        And for a while it seemed that the road back

                        Was a track bombarded by stubble like a snow.  

          The drift of this cortège d’esprit remains as difficult to gauge as the precise overhang of the palm which Stevens discerned as looming “at the end of the mind” when all impedimenta keeping self from soul have been brushed away. The inn of the title is but one more way-station in a rootless ellipse which, in Ashbery’s version of string theory, serves as time compacted into, but not necessarily at swim with, mortal space:

                        Stretching invisibly into the future so as to reappear

                        In our present. Its flexing is it account,

                        Return to the point of no return.  

          Again and again, what is released into the sanctum of an Ashbery poem is made to flit or flicker across timescapes festooned with ribbands that wound with renewed life without in the least redeeming the squandered opportunities that reduced them to mere scapes of time in the first place. What once was cruised, so goes the saw, cannot be cruised again with the quite same thrill of expectation or frisson of imagined delight. Promiscuity does not fund face lifts for those who throw all caution to the winds and frolic one cancer-inducing time too often in the blistering sun. Ultimately, concludes Ashbery in “The Ice-Cream Wars,” what we live through (no less than what we write about), reduces to no more than this:

                                                                        A few black smudges

                        On the outer boulevards, like squashed midges

                        And the truth becomes a hole, something one has always

                                    known,

                        A heaviness in the trees, and no one can say

                        Where it comes from, or how long it will stay—

                        A randomness, a darkness of one’s own.  

 

W. S. Merwin 

Sometimes, given the sheer bulk of bland and indifferent verse that has accumulated above his signature like trail-mix strewn Hansel and Gretel-fashion, one is tempted to insert W. S. Merwin (b. 1927) himself into his poem “The Drunk in the Furnace” as the type of inebriate adverted to in its title. One might, were it not that the drunk in question is kept songful by the spirits he imbibes and the poet, if that intoxicated, must have become so on liquors not of this world, for he certainly appears beyond the call of any sweet sounds that cordials known to man can inspire. I should confess here that try as I might, I could never quite get a handle on what the all the fuss made over Merwin was about. To an extent far exceeding any other “major” contemporary poet I know of, his verse has the flat and earthbound indistinction of having consistently achieved the opposite of lift-off not through anything he himself has done, but as the consequence of some hazy determination not ever to try very hard, with the unfortunately result that he has struck out looking more often than any brace of his competitors put together. His seems a verse that has taken an oath never to rise above scrub and aim at heights even minimally deemable as “poetic.” In the main that pledge has been adhered to, no matter how tempting higher ground might occasionally have looked. “The Asians Dying,” inspired by the Vietnam debacle, catches Merwin in his usual comfort zone in lieu of more tempting blandishments made to poets by Mount Parnassus. He always preferred to pitch camp at the base of the sublime, where no Everest or Mont Blanc might threaten to rouse the thoroughly repressed Shelley in him.  

                        When the forests have been destroyed their darkness

                                    remains

                        The ash the great walker follows the possessors

                        Forever

                        Nothing they will come to is real

                        Nor for long

                        Over the watercourses

                        Like ducks in the time of the ducks

                        The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky

                        Making a new twilight

 

                        Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead

                        Again again with its pointless sound

                        When the moon finds them they are the color of everything . . .  

          This is Merwin, circa 1967. Thirty years later, in “A Given Day,” wisps of experimentaIism still float cirrus-like over the flatland, as do prim demurrals of anything acknowledgeable as Bergsonian durée or time felt as kairos rather than mere chronos:

                        When I wake I find it is late in the autumn

                                    the hard rain has passed and the sunlight has not yet reached

                        the tips of the dark leaves that are their own shadows still

                                    and I am home it is coming back to me I am

                        remembering the gradual sweetness of morning

                                    the clear spring of being here as it rise one by one

                        in silence and without a pause and is the only one

                                    then one at a time I remember without understanding

                        some that have gone and arise only not to be here

                                    an afternoon walking on a bridge thinking of a friend

                        when she was still alive while a door from a building

                                    being demolished sailed down through the passing city

                        my mother half my age at a window long since removed

                                    friends in the same rooms and the words dreaming between us

                        the eyes of animals upon me they are all here

                                    in the clearness of the morning in the first light

                        that remembers its way now to the flowers of winter  

          One could go on and mine his mother lode for exceptions to his ever-present as-a-rule, but it really wouldn’t alter the complexion of the one-face-fits-all mask Merwin’s verse presents to the world. So far as anyone can tell who’s interested in probing the value of such poetry beyond the level common to claques, blurb writers, and Helen Hennessy Vendler, there’s little in his verse that isn’t preoccupied either with hamstringing what might be creditable if more arduously pursued or pursuing what might otherwise not seem dredged from some travel writer’s notebook. Credit should certainly be given Merwin’s translations published over many years of French, Spanish, Latin, and Portuguese classics, with a very special nod to his superb Poem of the Cid and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Worthy of mention also, is his prose collection The Miner’s Pale Children (1970), whose vignettes waver evocatively between the pellucid and the ethereal, like pieces culled from some newspaper printed in heaven. Reissued in 1994, its contents seem even more impressive now than in the ‘60s when The New Yorker first showcased a selection of them. They appeared inimitable unclassifiables then, and still do, ”The Weight of Sleep” and “The Remembering Machines of Tomorrow” standing out as particularly memorable. But apart from these few fugitive efforts, it’s hard to imagine much from the Merwin sprawl of annuals ever rising to the garden of perennials.  

 

James Wright

Back in 1977, I remarked, preparatory to quoting the first four lines of James Wright’s (b. 1927) “On the Liberation of Woman” (from his collection Two Citizens of 1973), that “only a paid audience finds everything interesting when that everything is rolled out as a prize exhibit; and so wisdom dictates—in poetry, at least—that some things be held back: a dissimulated reticence is preferable to a simulated exhibitionism.” I then invited my readers to share in the mixture of delight and consternation that the lines in question aroused in me by asking them to view in that light “the following décolletage from the boutique of James Wright.”  

          My point was (if it’s not already clear from the context provided) that easily parodied poets like James Wright were unwise to too ostentatiously flash their goods if the items in question were either undersized or deficient in get up and go. I felt at the time that Wright betrayed his insecurity about the ultimate value of his poetry and that he dealt with this by applying more body English to his mechanics instead of more usefully increasing his lyric involvement with the material he was sculpting. It’s not that he was incapable of producing relatively good, if not superior, verse. His well above average translations of German poetry is clearly demonstrated in his Lowell-like “imitations” of the impishly gnomic verse of Georg Trakl. Here is one of five of those imitations—not a lot to go by, but even these few lines show how apt Wright’s spare declaratives are for firming up Trakl’s filmy moonscapes:

                        In the farmyard the white moon of autumn shines,

                        Fantastic shadows fall from the eaves of the roof.

                        A silence is living in the empty windows;

                        Now from it the rats emerge softly

                        And skitter here and there, squeaking.  

          But such achievements are restricted to that sphere wherein one speaks as another poet might speak, were she disposed to ensilting in an alien language thought and emotion that only become sedimentary in his own. Speaking fervently and with lyrical authority about things rooted exclusively in your own language-world and in your own unique turf requires a very different fluency and ease of accommodation to foreign matter than is usually required of translators border-hopping from one logopoeia to another. Stuck as an Ohioan with a Midwestern patois of padded if not spongy locutions, Wright’s verse cedes what is laudably concrete in that idiom to Buckeye road crews and such, and makes do with the abstractions that foam over whenever the glass isn’t tilted the right way:

                        P. DOLAN and A. DOYLE

                        Have scrawled their names here,

                        You other stupid angels,

                        They have no wings

                        Here. Here all they have

                        Are squalling babies and the leaves

                        Of the wild strawberries you can still gather

                        Beside wet roads. . . .  

          This is about as caressing to the ear as Manhattan traffic is to anyone but Frank O’Hara who would’ve had it on his Walkman if they’d existed in the early ‘60s. The dedication to Wright’s composer friend Marsh and his music that is affixed to “Names Scarred at the Entrance to Chartres” seems oddly reversed: much in the poem might bring marshes to mind, but very little in its presentation smacks of the musical.  

          As a poet with strong working class roots, Wright usually could sense when something needed to be sent back to the shop to be retooled, and he made the superficies of his style as well as himself as a poet over a number of times in his career. Unfortunately, every time he set out to retool the tolerances got tighter in such a way that the music was squeezed into an ever thinner and scrapier monotone. Introibit  Francescatti of sorts, exit fortiter Milstein and Grumiaux. Thus, if early on in the Wright scenario—say about 1953—a poem like “A Blessing” could amble rhythmically and scrupulously avoid self-dug potholes leading up to minor culverts:

                        Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,

                        Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.

                        And the eyes of those two Indian ponies

                        Darken with kindness.

                        They have come gladly out of the willows

                        To welcome my friend and me.

                        We step over the barbed wire into the pasture

                        Where they have been grazing all day, alone.

                        They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness

                        That we have come.

                        They bow shy as wet swans. They love each other.

                        There is no loneliness like theirs—  

by 1968, unruly buckboards like “The Minneapolis Poem” were raising dust all over the Wright spread, with off-road clatter drowning out almost everything else: 

                        But I could not bear

                        To allow my poor brother my body to die

                        In Minneapolis.

                        The old man Walt Whitman our countryman

                        Is now in America our country

                        Dead.

                        But he was not buried in Minneapolis

                        At least.

                        And no more may I be

                        Please God.  

          Why the incessant harping throughout this guide on poets needing to show if not an exceptional musical sense, then at least a rudimentarily adequate one? Because I believe that if there was one thing Pound was absolutely right about, it was his insistence that music and literature were not just “sister arts” but Siamese twins joined forever at the ear. (They would be joined at the lip also, did anatomy not forbid a second juncture.) He realized that not only poetry, but prose as well, is intimately conjoined with music of a kind, albeit within a relationship closer to the subdominant than to the tonic. The notion that if figurative language isn’t tied to the rhythmic synapses linking optical and aural responses to the speech-making faculty, it’s not fit to wear the diadem of prose, let alone poetry’s royal crown, is far from outlandish. It thus seems strange that Wright’s verse (along with the equally out-of-favor poetry of Theodore Roethke) should be enjoying a revival right now. While renewed interest in their work may be no more than fallout from books recently published about them, but it does add to the spreading disquiet felt in some quarters over the speed and with which audible song is evaporating from American poetry. The concomitant decline of “serious” music also contributes to this unease; or it might just be that, in keeping with the ever-shrinking attention span of the nation’s 18-45-year-olds, interest is shrinking in all media that failing to transition to “interactive” modes. If something doesn’t come with a controller or X-Box, or doesn’t ladle synthetic music in low-fi out of a can, it’s no longer thought to fall within the category of info-tainment; and if it doesn’t do that, why should it possibly matter if it also happens not to be “art”?  

          That aside, one hopes the luck of better timing strikes the now posthumous Wright the second time around. His poetry does in retrospect seem a good deal more “interactive” than a lot routinely making the cut, and that does not exclude the verse of poets who exhibit far more control over mechanics than he ever did. The break-dance of the poetry that ended up in print just didn’t swing, and that’s sorrow and the pity of it. 

 

Philip Levine 

Philip Levine (b. 1928) almost always appears in anthologies represented by the same two or three war horses. De rigueur among the current crop of anthologists are “They Feed They Lion,” “Belle Isle, 1949,” and “You Can Have It.” (“Drum” is sometimes dragged in along with these, as with rather less frequency are “Red Dust,” “The Life Ahead,” “To a Child Trapped in a Barbershop,” and “Genius.”) Though Levine’s verse is less inherently “tough-minded” than others of the “poetry isn’t for sissies” persuasion, he is not unfairly pigeonholed as a stoic who makes much of having been “schooled in the hard knocks of applied moralism.” What differentiates him from others similarly backgrounded is that he talks the walk of his moralism as well as its talk, thus prompting inevitable comparisons with certain lions of the ‘30s who, having outgrown the naïveté common to those canonized by progressivist historians like Daniel Aaron (of Writers on the Left), refuse to endorse the neocon version of what is right, even as doublethink-tanks proliferate to give employment to literary bottom feeders only minimally less scrupled than the white-only sharks beached at Fox Cable News.  

          Could it have been the Stanford poetry fellowship Levine received in 1958, with its chance to gauge the clay in Yvor Winters’s feet from floor level, that landed him with that famous “sense of direction” so often mentioned in reviews of his work? Critics (including some not ideally receptive to Levine’s deli-cut tranches de vie) note a Sisyphean resolve asserting itself in his verse, an earnestness perhaps born of having schlepped a weighty backpack up a not inconsiderable slope for quite a number of years before establishing a place for himself in the pecking order of American poets.  

          Often, this earnestness communicates itself as a dourness not unlike the sour-rye obstinacy undergirding the dramas of Arthur Miller between All My Sons and Death of a Salesman, a grittiness bearing witness to a Depression-spent youth and depression-avoiding maturity. Toughness of that sort might well sprout from blue-collar roots, but its hardness no less than its shelf life evince the heavy lifting required to keep alive one’s faith in the imagination’s power to transform “car parts, dead fish, stolen bicycles” into “the slow light of Friday morning in Michigan, / the one we waited for.” At times, the assiduousness needed just to keep one’s shoulder to the wheel proves in itself a little wearing, as when Levine’s poems sound in spite of themselves not unlike Clifford Odets might sound after a severely frowning J. V. Cunningham has shown him the shed. Or is it the other way around? At any rate, an inventive casuist doing double duty as an anthology headnote-writer has dubbed Levine “a master of extraordinarily colloquial diction.” One would think that being an “extraordinarily colloquial” anything would involve at the very least some knots of verbal elegance being tugged loose. But perhaps that headnote-writer was doing no more than anthology-piecing together Levine’s multifarious versions of how “They Lion grow,” which, as scads of his poems in their one-declamation-fits-all style tell us, is “out of”

                        West Virginia to Kiss My Ass, out of buried aunties,

                        Mothers hardening like pounded stumps, out of stumps,

                        Out of the bones’ need to sharpen and the muscles to stretch . . .  

          Or take “Red Dust,” in which the speaker, a typical Class-A hard case declares: “I do not believe in sorrow; / It is not American.” Thus is Levine’s reader prepped for the reductio ad horrendum of his poem’s conclusion which is formulated (as Levine’s optimal manner more often than not dictates) in clots not unreminiscent of freeze-dried blood:

                        And so my mind closes around

                        a square oil can crushed on the road

                        one morning, startled it was not

                        the usual cat. If a crow

                        had come out of the air to choose

                        its entrails could I have laughed? . . .  

          Or, yet again, in “The Life Ahead,” where a dreamer shocked awake is hard put to blink his living nightmares into focus for those lucky enough to be able to sleep through theirs with relative peacefulness, even if their adolescence, like Levine’s own, was spent in a hell’s kitchen much like his Detroit:                                                                      

           There was a river in Detroit

             and if you crossed it you

             were in another country,

             but something always

called me back, a woman

who had no use for me

or a brother who did [. . .] Something

called me back to this life,

and I came home to wander

the schoolyard again

as a lost boy and find

above or below the world

was here and now, drowning

in oil, second by second

borrowed from the clock.  

          But it is in poems like “Genius” where Levine’s gift comes most triumphantly home to roost—and with a distinctly Yeatsian hold on the barnyard, too. This 1981 poem, brief and for once, only lightly sautéed in motor oil, captures an aging poet’s pride in being able at last to see his romantic illusions surrendered without first having had them pried, like an NRA member’s assault rifle, from his cold, dead fingers.

                        Two old dancing shoes my grandfather

                        gave the Christian Ladies,

                        an unpaid water bill, the rear license

                        of a dog that messed on your lawn,

                        a tooth I saved for the good fairy

                        and which is stained with base metals

                        and plastic filler. With these images

                        and your black luck and my bad breath

                        a bright beginner could make a poem

                        in fourteen rhyming lines about the purity

                        of first love or the rose’s many thorns

                        or the dew that won’t wait long enough

                        to stand my little gray wren a drink.  

          One line lacking for a sonnet but none short of a wholly fitting envoi to a life spent abolishing boundaries between the messiness of dogs having commerce with lawns and the thorniness of justifying love’s ways to ardor. Working, one might more colorfully say, to dissolve false partitions thrown up between duty—and duty.  

 

Irving Feldman

The raw, naked genius of Irving Feldman’s verse (b. 1928), has to be one of the best kept open secrets in all contemporary American poetry. Only the rather more obscure one that Louis Zukofsky could outmelodize even Ezra Pound at his own trouvère game was ever played more close to the vest. Feldman’s Collected Poems: 1954-2004, published last year, had to wait for Schocken Books, a house specializing in works by Jewish authors, on mostly Jewish themes, for a predominantly Jewish audience to take it up. Not that there’s anything particularly degrading in this; it’s just that the fate of a poet of Feldman’s stature shouldn’t have to wait upon the narrow priorities of a distinctly sectarian press, even if it’s author list includes names like Kafka, Benjamin, Buber, and Josef Roth among its luminaries. Though Feldman has spent decades tucked away at the Buffalo campus of the State University of New York, an institution that sank from star status in the late ‘60’s and early ‘70s, serious damage done by his having survived residency there is, if to be noted at all, scarcely noticeable. Talent and the ability to compartmentalize alone kept him from devolving into another Alan Dugan, a curmudgeon’s curmudgeon, for whom sharecropping a back corner of the Bukowski plantation (only slightly less incorrect politically than the master’s own) was enough of a sinecure to keep his wits sharp and his brusqueness keen. Had Feldman chosen to go that route he might well have ended up as one-eyed as Dugan, chained to a pathetic strip of Gazan defiance reserved for Samson-wannabes. With this single difference to be drawn: if Levine’s satiric verse has a hint of the smartass about it, the smart half of the composite keeps its ass well to the rear and on an extremely short leash. That way, should either the beastly or the burdensome in his verse feel the need to kick up its heels, it can do so without knocking into its own bumptiousness and injuring itself.  

          Fortunately for him, Feldman, unlike Bukowski and Dugan, never felt driven to spurn the consciously artful, and we have the cluster of marvels that is his Collected Poems to prove it. Open its 425 pages anywhere and indispensable poems—American poems—pour out of hiding like friends at a surprise party, while still more only slightly less accomplished, gleam like tree ornaments in Rockefeller Plaza at Christmas-time. Feldman, it grows ever plainer each day, did not sidle edgewise into his considerable poetic gifts as if they were stiff new shoes. That exceptional talent of his was up and running from the beginning and as archingly full blown as marigolds in June. To seize upon just one proof of Feldman’s ripeness at point of début, “Man,” the first of the six parts of the long poem “Goya” from his first collection Works and Days (1961), bypasses the young and promising poet’s jejune precocity—

                        The soldiers bear a sack,

                        A white sack without a tear;

                        The soldiers are in black.

                        For the rest, the plain is bare.

                        And what else should be there?

 

                        They carry the sack,

                        They do the best they can;

                        One in his arms, another on his back.

                        Are these animals? their bag of bran?

                        No. These are men. This is a man.  

—by blooming so radiantly and without glint of rehearsal that blossoming is made to seem a waste of time.  

          Feldman was done with rhyme (though not with loose-limbed meter) soon after this early collection, but would be as hard to imagine someone doing more with the less brilliantly skeletized in these ten lines as to find a critic of the opinion that this theme might have profited from more voluble exposition. The poem, like Pound’s “In a Station of the Metro,” is what it is and makes its point by compacting the surety of the homiletic with icy clarity of a lament rinsed with purest hokku. What else should be there?  

          Some of the later collections would see the Feldman line swirling toward progressively lengthening spirals, their occasional longueurs beginning to wear only when in the course of succumbing to what Yvor Winters’s “imitative fallacy,” they slacken, as here in “The Girlfriend,” into consonantal drift:

                        It all began when poor messed-up Lara called.

                        Oh, the same, the same: boyfriend down the tubes;

                        mother throwing fits; job post-terminal;

                        biological clock in doomsday mode;

                        her men shrinks were bullies, the women were,

                        if possible, worse: critical, envious,

                        What didn’t shrink was her laundry list

                        —the slights and frights, sobs, rages, gripes

                        wouldn’t come clean for all her self-expressing. . . .  

          The saving grace of such lines (when not too slack) is to permit the expansion of a territorial imperiousness that releases the poet to pursue quasi-novelistic ambitions in verse. (Akin to those given vent to in poem-novels like Vikram Seth’s Golden Gate, they avoid the debilities modern narrative verse  is heir to, like the higher phlegmatics fogging up works in this vein by Robinson Jeffers and Robert Penn Warren, to name but two writers so afflicted.) Feldman’s “Jewishness” may hover Shekkinah-like over the corpus of his work, but its there-ness is like the dove of the Holy Ghost in that marvelous painting by Giotto: it obtrudes in order to guarantee the closeness to grace of everything it stalls over, the fallibility of man not excluded. True, the reclusive siren of ethnic identity is a temptress Feldman but infrequently connects with: it remains a hot property he prefers now and then to date rather than take home to meet the family. He is—to give a tired formula yet another jog—a poet who happens to be Jewish rather than a card-carrying Jewish author in the mould of an Isaac Bashevis Singer or Scholem Aleichem. In this, Feldman resembles the late Canadian poet Irving Layton—or would, if he had more of the blood of Catullus or Juvenal and less of Addision in his veins. Still, when need arises he can coax a Singer-like turn on a dime, like this one from “The Dream,” with the best of the Malamud-runners—

                        And just so daily somewhere Messiah

                        is shunned like a beggar at the door because

                        someone has something he wants to finish

                        or just something better to do, something

                        he prefers not to put off forever

                        —some little pleasure so deeply wished

                        that Heaven’s coming has to seem bad luck

                        or worse, God’s intruding selfishness.  

—and in the very next poem, “The Life and Letters,” return to the secular debate as though the right to muse neurotically was an entitlement not unique to proponents of intelligent design holding forth at the high table:

                        And then. And then. And then.

                        And then no letter came back.

                        And soon no letter went forward.

                        Why listen now to people talking?

                        The demon settled into self-consumption.

                        And everything was still.

                        Dust silted over the phantom children

                        he’d never wanted anyhow;

                        at the end of its rainbow his wife’s hair

                        came to rest on red—forever;

                        their house faded in the manuscripts. . . .  

          In longer pieces given over to “infernal recurrence,” Feldman comes near to rivaling the master of the granitic, Frost, and in “In Theme Park America” the W. C. Williams of Spring and All with its irrepressible idiomizing of “pure products of America [going] crazy.” But for all-around exquisiteness—though there are far too many magnificent, and marvelously heterogeneous, triumphs in the Collected Poems to over-singularize the wonderfulness of any—“The Grand Magic Theater Finale” (if only for the exuberance with which it reunites Stevens and Yeats in corndog heaven), takes the absolute cake. Here, as is usual with Feldman, only the uncut version of the poem will do:

                        The curse was to claw the earth with their hands

                        in the dark until every cue was handed up.

 

                        And then the liberation of light blazing.

                        And here, out of their roles, the cast comes back

                        in costume still—how shy they seem of those rich

                        stigmata—marking time, shambling their steps.

                        See, the stars, too, have lined up with the chorus,

                        at last, face to face. And look at the lot

                        bust loose, stomp and prance, shake that dyna-mite.

                        There’s nothing they don’t over-over-over-do.

                        And what life they must have to be so different

                        every time we look! Like half-molted metaphors

                        —at ease in two worlds at once—they ad-lib

                        and swank their old impersonations for us

                        as if to say, All that was just kidding.

                        This happiness is the serious stuff.

                                                            .    .    .

                        Their exuberance, their soaring

                        would break our hearts if they weren’t making

                        everything larger, ourselves immortal,

                        with laughter. And surely they must know it,

                        singing out louder, reaching out their arms to us.

                        And who can say what they are begging and bringing?

                        Our cheering says, Freedom! Feeling!—from which

                        they wave, riding high, blowing both-handed kisses,

                        What wonderful people—you’re all angels.

                        Not goodbye but hello, folks, welcome to heaven!

Adrienne Rich

Adrienne Rich (b. 1929) could have been—to quote a phrase as battered as the palooka in the Schulberg potboiler On the Waterfront who utters it—“a contender.” Instead, she chose to assume, somewhere between middling youth and menopause, the mantle of a feminist Hardcase in Point. Since for ever, it seems like, Rich has been proclaiming she is not a poet-feminist but a feminist poet, obliged (an obligation different in no way that I can see from a calling) to obstruct the Patriarchy wherever—and here we need reach for another moldy-fig phrase—it rears its ugly head. This is to say that Rich saw her poet’s role as both exceeding in scope and transcending in its grasp that pursued by activists and activist-critics like Judith Butler and Toril Moi. On this view, the proper vocation of socially responsible women since the ‘70s was to broaden the agenda of post-‘60s feminism by tempering the shrill, largely lesbian apologetics put out by burning-bed sexual politicians of the Andrea Dworkin mold with a more measured advocacy of female independence on the one hand and female-on-female interdependence on the other. Has this tightrope act turned Rich into an agitpropagandist speaking only to the choir of feminist poets like herself and a few sisters-in-entitlement outside the arts? Not at all. The inter-activist wars of the ‘60s taught her that power was all about keeps and keeping. Thus, since her conversion to same-sex proselytizing in the early ‘70s this sister has kept her co-peers in the hood by keeping a sharp eye on the balls in power and her needlepoint politics aligned with that most inflexible of the Newtonian iron laws which stipulates that final effects can be ascribed only to efficient causes.  

         Such public positioning (some might call it posturing) has served Rich mighty well over the last several decades, but it has proved somewhat detrimental too, in that her blinkered sense of the erotic seemed to critics then a stance which deprived much of what she wrote of needed emotional range and catholicity. And the situation has worsened rather than gotten better since: what she has more lately intoned about in her verse has rarely survived the thumbscrew calculus imposed on its content by her sexual politics. Indeed, the strong liberationist wind blowing through her work is often deflected by the severity of the persona whose moistened finger is testing its direction for ideological advantage. On a rather different level, the wheels within wheels driving the typical Rich poem might seem to be behaving according to spec, but a closer look reveals something very different going on. The line of motion propelling Rich’s idiolect appears to be forever losing traction to the dual-directional drag that makes any such polemical car-and-trailer a house divided against itself. When strong syllables haul themselves over an obstacle course like prostheses in a conga line, the music of poetry gets lost amid its own shuffling arrhythmias. Note, for instance, the stop-and-go agogics of “Love Poem XXI”:  

                        The dark lintels, the blue and foreign stones

                        of the great round rippled by stone implements

                        of the midsummer night light rising from beneath

                        the horizon—when I said “a cleft of light”

                        I meant this. And this is not Stonehenge

                        simply nor any place but the mind

                        casting back to where her solitude,

                        shared, could be chosen without loneliness,

                        not easily nor without pains to stake out

                        the circle, the heavy shadows, the great light.

                        I chose to be a figure in that light,

                        half-blotted by darkness, something moving

                        across that space, the color of stone

                        greeting the moon, yet more than stone:

                        a woman. I choose to walk here. And to draw this circle.  

     To start with, the conceit driving the poem (which triangulates primordial astrophysics, light, and the claro imago of Woman), is so far-fetched and under-endowed that even a Donne understudy ignorant of Gongora would know that such “teach me to hear mermaids singing” stretches don’t go the distance. However, that’s not the only item on this poem’s plaguey bill. Rich has tried, unsuccessfully, it seems to me, to feel with her head and root about the sensory deprivation tank she’s immersed herself in with her emotions. The result is a clutch of emotionally over-laden pilings being erected where an already overextended diagrammatics has failed to clear proper space for them. It’s no mystery what happens when damn-fool iambics rush in where angels of prosody would quite sensibly fear to tread. In the first four lines of “Love Poem XXI,” syllables ricochet off one another like molecules fleeing an overheated gas bubble. Pronounce aloud “And this is not Stonehenge /simply nor any place but the mind /casting back to where her solitude /shared, could be chosen without loneliness. . .,” and what trippingly rakes itself over the coals is the tongue itself, not a garland of phrases made gorgeous by its own words’ lingual caress. Were it not for the Martha Stewart-like officiousness with which the pastry shell of a Rich poem is stuffed with relevance like a meat pie, the hamhandedness of it all would turn more readers off than it does. What chimera of melopoeia, one wonders, could possibly have led the author of “Grandmothers” to imagine that beneath the expanse of all those elephant palms an orchid of inestimable worth lay hid?

                        We had no pet names, no diminutives for you,

                        always the formal guest under my father’s roof:

                        you were “Grandmother Jones” and you visited rarely.

                        I see you walking up and down the garden,

                        restless, southern-accented, reserved, you did not seem

                        my mother’s mother or anyone’s grandmother. . . .  

        Rich does manage occasionally—especially in work antedating her deliquescence into the programmatic (that is, between 1951 and 1971)—to ignite some roman candles amid the hullabaloo of cherry bombs and barely glinting sparklers. Trim and redoubtable triumphs such as “Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers,” “Face to Face,” and, of course, “Diving into the Wreck” (dated 1973, and thus simultaneously the last of her best work and the best of her last ones), dot her work with a kind of grim persistence, landing her among other poets roughly her age the briefly realized promise of whom offset, if only to a negligible degree, the long and steady decline of their talent. That small degree notwithstanding, the promise that gleamed so providentially in certain youthful poems as well as in a sprinkle of later ones cannot dampen the impression of Rich’s lengthy career (now in well-greased glide toward what looks increasingly like flat lining) as a catenary of executions no more diverting or eventful than a passably brought off skater’s waltz. There hovers over much of her writing in both verse and prose an easeful pretense of risk which, in the decades before the present crop of neocons began making their winter of discontent everyone else’s as well, sat well with a poetic community accustomed to meeting displays of political correctness with plaudits due feats of uncommon bravery. For that reason I feel compelled to say that if there’ve been poets, socially conscious or otherwise, in the last quarter-century who’ve brandished politics more goose-steppingly correct than Adrienne Cecile Rich’s, they have escaped my notice. No Robert Bly, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, or even Charles Bernstein can compete with Rich for the sheer commissar-esque sang froid with which she has laid down her party’s line. While credit is clearly due her for the many pro bono projects undertaken by her over the years (her work over the years with inner-city youth has been particularly laudable), she seems always to have put ideological agendas ahead of adding so much as a cubit to the stature of poetry as an art which is valuable in itself, which is to say above politics. No doubt an exceptionally compassionate heart beats somewhere within that formidable chest of drawers which is the Rich fund-in-trust. But for all the need poets must feel to share their wealth of spirit with the poor, there has to be more to being Rich than playing big sister to a lot of weak sisters busy crying wolf at every male whistle, and Whistler’s mother to a lot of men content to keep their windjammers at half-mast.

 
Gary Snyder

There are times when one would like to think that only the work of Gary Snyder (b. 1930) and a very few others among the many pretenders to grace thrown up by the Beat phenomenon will still be making the rounds 25-50 years from now when “the face still forming” that is contemporary American poetry is finally discernible. I say this because there is much that is likeable as well as to like about Snyder’s writings, some quirk of inner loveliness that has clung to them and to him despite daunting layovers in Japanese monasteries and bust-out reunions—some lasting months or years—with such zanies of “true-life fiction” as the King of Fizz (and Pop) who dropped The Dharma Bums and Big Sur into our laps, Jack Kerouac.  

      Snyder, bless his heart, was always more “serious” than the rest of that herd of wintering buffalo that included, as well as the above mentioned hoary bison, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and, heaven knows, far more practically endowed. He was always able to declare his (always tenuous) Beat affiliations off-side whenever they threatened to overwhelm his cause of nature conservancy with clichés out either T. D. Sizuki‘s or Smoky the Bear’s playbook. On the whole, Snyder wished for no more out of life than to be able to cultivate his Bonsai garden in peace, and to carry (via that stone-cutter’s chronicle of his which is as much diary as poem, as much religious observance as Walden Pond rock-skimming), the re-energizing begun by Pound of Confucian wisdom (chih) enshrined in fastidiously precise language (CH’ing ming)—along with the revival, equally auspicious, of Ko, the Japanese Zen “season of the earth”—one giant step further.  

         In his own very quiet way, Snyder has over five decades made himself into a prime exponent of the “”earth house hold” eclogue (his own signature piece—along with an invention he calls the “hitch-haiku”), and of that variant of wilderness palm pilotry among whose lapidary marvels poems like “Riprap” reign supreme. Only Snyder has that knack whereby the rune-like poem is transformed into the very facsimile of what its dispositional shape is designed to exalt. The entire poem begs to be quoted in full:

                        Lay down these words

                        Before your mind like rocks.

                                     placed solid, by hands

                        In choice of place, set

                        Before the body of the mind

                                     in space and time:

                        Solidity of bark, leaf, or wall

                                     riprap of things:

                        Cobble of milky way,

                                     straying planets,

                        These poems, people,

                                     lost ponies with

                        Dragging saddles

                                     and rocky sure-foot trails.

                        The worlds like an endless

                                     four-dimensional

                        Game of Go.

                                     ants and pebbles

                        In the thin loam, each rock a word

                                     a creek-washed stone

                        Granite: ingrained

                                     with torment of fire and weight

                        Crystal and sediment linked hot

                                     all change, in thoughts,

                        As well as things.  

       Note that the two halves of the poem, corresponding to rip and rap, are punctuated independently, forcing the eye to accept as given what the ear has already intuitively grasped as “definitive.” Much here may be chalked up to pointers gleaned from Pound’s Pisan Cantos, which are then distilled (via certain improvisatory attention-focusers, courtesy of Black Mountain) into a burgeoning Geistsraum whose sphere of operations appears no more mysterious than a handheld apparatus the directions for handling which may be found in that owner’s-manual-in-the-shape-of-a-poem Snyder has thoughtfully supplied us with. Though such timely reductions account only for a part—the haptic part—of that pact established by the poet with his readers, like his brother-in-arms Creeley, Snyder’s aim is not just to bring the brunt of the sensory into range of touch, but to make the whole verse-writing process an intimate of its totalizing embrace. For the open field poet, the intellect is a screen door useful less to keep impurities out than to let the sun in, in all its darkness-excising splendor. Apart from light thrown on the poet’s most personal life-thoughts, another reason (no less integral to the Projectivist or, to invoke Denise Levertov’s term, “organic,” project) for poetry to remain open to experience is to faithfully represent, through diaristic notation not so remote from that of music, the defining innerness of locus and ethos indispensable to the poet’s life. “Milton by Firelight,” “Above Pate Valley,” and “The Wild Edge” are splendid examples of this, while “The Bath,” “Axe Handles,” and “The Elwha River” are self-stalkings so personal they almost make The Prelude seem an autobiographical lark inflated to epic hyperbole.  

          Despite the cachet he acquired in the ‘60s as a student-friendly poet, Snyder curiously remains among the most underrated poets of his generation—perhaps because of his continuing popularity with the young. If that is what’s behind his work’s being undervalued, we need to examine the basis on which we judge the merits of certain stubbornly unpopular poets more closely. After all, even Baudelaire was loath to go up against the grainy metricalities of his time, was indeed reluctant to contest any convention of stylistics the avoidance of which might encourage censors to give his poetry’s subject matter and suspect morality a second look. Such matters aside, Snyder’s poetry is decidedly worthy of a different kind of second look from editors and publishers beyond the limited if serviceable ambit of the New Directions and City Lights imprints. After all, how many of our poets can cram into three lines (the entire poem consists of 36 lines) the “gists and piths” involved in transmitting a timeless craft to one’s progeny, as “Axe Handles" does so unforgettably?

                        One afternoon the last week in April

                        Showing Kai how to throw a hatchet

                        One-half turn and it sticks in a stump . . . ?  

Would that more of our poets would follow the conceptual tack of a poetry built upon working principles of the sort pioneered by Snyder, Paul Blackburn, Jon Wieners, and Edward Dorn, poets who, along with Creeley and Levertov, remain the cream of what was once a bumper crop of “Make it new-ers.” It’s a pity that only Yusef Komunyakaa, Henri Cole, Li-Young-Lee, and an exiguous handful of others seem intent on revisiting this path without going to extremes favored by protégés of Marjorie Perloff, to whom journals such as Brad Morrow’s Conjunctions continue the forum of choice.

 
Mark Strand

Mark Strand (b.1934), to a greater extent than most of his contemporaries, comes off as more apparition than presence, more display of ominously smiling feline (out of Lewis Carroll, perhaps) than actual cat. In ways disturbing even for dabblers in surrealism, he persists the illusionist who with a single desultory wand-wave can vanish, wraith-like, into the middle distance. This need not be viewed as a disparagement. Strand’s well-tonsured mystique of the well-tonsured mysterioso has been an object of careful cultivation for quite a few moons now, he himself having broached this widespread impression—like him, lean nigh on to disappearance—in “Keeping Things Whole,” a slip of a poem that touches whimsically though substantively as much on the insubstantiality of its author’s form as on his matter:

                        In a field

                        I am the absence

                        of field.

                        This is

                        always the case.

                        Wherever I am

                        I am what is missing.

 

           When I walk

            I part the air

           and always

           the air moves in

           to fill the spaces

           where my body’s been. . . .  

          Even more to the forefront of Strand’s strategy of dissimulation is an obsession with physical disappearance, which, given the unexceptionability of his personal, educational and working life, does not so much as meet minimalist standards for personal weirdness affected by a surrealist, unless his time at Yale also involved recruitment as a CIA spook. (With considerable metonymic oddness, his case-file resembles that of Robert Ludlum’s rogue-amnesiac Jason Bourne, in that while the latter has a real-life identity to wield as well as withhold, he can’t seem to get his mind or his hands around it.)  

          What Strand and other irrealists resembling him bring to poetry is a desire not so much to transcend as to do an end run around what Bertolt Brecht immortalized as Entfremdung, or estrangement of matter from medium. Such a technique traffics widely in alienation but still remains a far cry from whatever it is that makes the tenor of poems like “Eating Poetry” and “The Prediction” so upratchetingly unnerving. Virtually every Strand poem applies its own unheimlich maneuver to reality’s windpipe, revealing thereby that to unhinge the predictable by de-Freudianizing the uncanny is to pare away the casing of an existential rather than a psychological dissymmetry. “The Prediction” has to be the crux and locus classicus of all generalizing about Strand as laureate of the “stand-in reality” pop-up that disquiets by watching you watch it watch you:

                        That night the moon drifted over the pond,

                        turning the water to milk, and under

                        the boughs of the trees, the blue trees,

                        a young woman walked, and for an instant

 

                        the future came to her:

                        rain falling on her husband’s grave, rain falling

                        on the lawns of her children, her own mouth

                        filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,

 

                        a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it,

                        a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,

                        thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising

                        and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.  

          Imagine, if you will, an Escher sketch in which every level is a superimposed copy of itself copied precisely to look as it did before it was superimposed but reproduced verso so as to make its superimposition seem subtractive rather than additive, and you have arrived at a simulacrum of just how a Strand poem becomes like those roses in Eliot’s Four Quartets which “have the look of roses that are looked at.” Or better yet, consider the off-the-wall teaser used by the comedian Stephen Wright used about how he realized when returning home one night that each of his possessions had been stolen and replaced with a perfect replica. Likewise, in Strand’s world existence is not an accident of being but always and with stunning inherence an antic rather than ontic twist on coming to be. This last, unlike becoming, resembles more tinglingly what it feels like to come upon a discontinuation unawares—as, for example, in coming to “this” in the manner suggested in “Coming to This”:

                        We have done what we wanted.

                        We have discarded dreams, preferring the heavy industry

                        of each other, and we have welcomed grief

                        and called ruin the impossible habit to break.

 

                        And now we are here.

                        The dinner is ready and we cannot eat.

                        The meat sits in the white lake of its dish.

                        The wine waits.

 

                        Coming to this

                        has its rewards: nothing is promised, nothing is taken away.

                        We have no heart or saving grace,

                        no place to go, no reason to remain.  

          There is something about a poet responding to the inner command, “Faites vos jeux d’esprit,” that seems rather too pat, even—one hates to say this straight out—facile. The too-good-to-be-true rebus of Mark Strand, poet-in-virtual-exile, looks somewhat disconcertingly here to be kicking in again in such a way as to confirm the suspicion that poetry really is, as T. S. Eliot once declared, “a mug’s game.” Or in the Strandian corner of this trope, a pose built up into a Masque of Unreason enjoying posing as Death cat-scanned just to rattle the hoi-polloi. To be sure, American poetry has undergone a make-over since the ‘60s, with numerous coats of paint having surrealistically been splashed on its homely physog. But the mainframe unsettlings Strand goes in for far outstrip the laptop frissons that are the stock in trade of a Michael Palmer or a Charles Simic. A Strandian unmooring of Houseboat Reality is always a strictly zero-sum affair: its intent is to leave the reader hanging, if only by the narrowest hair, to that terra infirma-cum-Sheol the recently scrubbed HBO series, Carnivale, labored mightily to strand (no pun intended) its viewers in. Up till now, Strand has proven a survivor, even if the stakes keeping him in the game have mustered fewer distinctly blue chips than previously. For ten years following the much heralded publication of his Selected Poems (1980), he published relatively little in the way of new poetry. Then, three collections in more or less swift succession—The Continuous Life (1990), Dark Harbor (1993), and Blizzard of One (1998). None raised much of a din in anyone’s head, but then, how many new books of poems do? Even Ashbery’s Sebastian Venable-like productions nearly every autumn surrender to David Copperfield-like magic by the time a new one is due. (Who today speaks animatedly of Chinese Whispers or Girl on the Run?) Rather than dwell on new things for a respectable period, we prefer as a culture to stoke our love affair with recycling that the recording industry and the rest of the media seem so caught up in. Tenuously senior poets whose Collected Poems are subject to burial with the same dispatch as the remains of their authors provide the only reality-fix we ever fix on in reissue-fixated times such as ours.

 
Charles Wright

Like the staring contest between Mark Strand and Avernus in which each, at least so far, has yet to blink, Charles Wright’s (b. 1935) dalliance with “death, memory, landscape, language, and God”—also a career-length instance of metonymy—has won him the regard—awe-drenched in some cases—of critics who not only fall for “oceanic themes” like a ton of bricks (think James Cameron and the film Titanic) but also insist that grab-bags like the faux-Vedas of Jerome Rothenberg be cherished as the cutest darn things since Hesiod’s Theogony began the collation of works and days. What is it, one wonders, giving vent to a bemusement that could halt Erato in her tracks, that would compel even a Dittohead Whitmanite like Wright to confess, that “out of any two thoughts I have, one is devoted to death”? Must Lawrence’s Studies in Classic American Literature, W. C. Williams’s In the American Grain, and the pungently plurisignative tomes of Edward Dahlberg be combined to muster the IQ needed to do justice to that question? Rereading all of Wright won’t do it, for he and his soul mates are at the center of its muddle, swimming wildly toward the nub of the vortex. Yes, we are at swim again with a poet whose work divides without conquering what it comes at and sees only through a glass darkly what it lusts after with contumely. The division before this house separates the admirers of Wright as a seer of the “intensive” from those who view him as the not-quite Goethean Heimrat of the prolusively “extensive.” Or, citing a recent anthologist, “between the concision of haiku and the rambling openness of the long poem.”  

          Wright has not blenched, even under intense interrogation by The Paris Review, at owning up to a marked propensity for “sprawling” in his poems. (He cuts the losses this might tend to incur by hastily adding, “with a succession of sufficient checks and balances.”) Having once allied himself with Deep Image poets of the school of Bly, Merwin, and the other Wright—James—he found his second poetic wind a few decades later when he was taken with the notion of choreographing his own verbal reënactment of the Ghost Dance of 1890, an incendiary event that all but set New Mexico ablaze when it was performed. Much has been made by reviewers of the obsession with syllable counting and numerology that erupted from Wright’s segue into his career’s second phase. As Jahan Ramazani puts it,

Since Wright eschews fixed meter and rhyme, the organizing principles behind his porous yet tightly structured poetry are not immediately self-evident. He has referred to the seven-syllable line as his “ur-line,” and most of his lines have an odd number of syllables(he counts a dropped line as part of the same line). The numerological patterning of his work extends from this micro level of syllable count to the number of lines within stanzas, the number of stanzas or sections within poems, the mirror relations among poems within a volume, and even the ordering of books across the career. . . .  

And to think some thought Marianne Moore a doily short of an antimacassar!  

          Ignoring the weird word counts, it’s sometimes hard to know just where in the self-storage space Wright’s aesthetic rents a poem like “Stray Paragraphs in February, Year of the Rat” (1997) ought to be stowed:

                        East of town, the countryside unwrinkles and smooths out

                        Unctuously toward the tidewater and gruff Atlantic.

                        A love of landscape’s a true affection for regret, I’ve found,

                        Forever joined, forever apart,

                                                                        outside us yet ourselves.

 

                        Renunciation, it’s hard to learn, is now our ecstasy.

                        However, if God were still around,

                                                 he’d swallow our sighs in his nothingness.

 

                        The dregs of the absolute are slow sift in my blood,

                        Dead branches down after high winds, dead yard grass and

                                    undergrowth—

                        The sure accumulation of all that’s not revealed

                        Rises like snow in my bare places,

                                                                        cross-whipped and openmouthed.

 

                        Our lives can’t be lived in flames.

                        Our lives can’t be lit like saints’ hearts,

                                                                        seared between heaven and earth. . . .  

       It’s not that as poetry its spin evades the looms of established verse forms or genres; it’s that, as verbal weave, it’s all bobbin and spindle, woof and warp, with hardly one lick of real flax to rub up against another. How, apart from its tendency to crawl graphically down the page, is Wright’s “revelatory” bone meal different from the mercurially bound amalgam with which the Maximus Poems of Charles Olson stuffs the cavities of its argument? Olson, too, made outlandish claims for the potency of the syllable, believing it superior to the line through the privilege it earned as head tutor to the heart. Olson, it should not be forgotten, became notorious for laying girder upon girder of poem-talk interspersed with long tone-deaf patches of pedantry, all of which falling under the shade of toppling towers of abstraction gleaned from this historiographer of decline or that.  

          Not that Wright is given comparably to the splitting of hairs: if anything, he prefers it pulled out by the handful, so that his way with scrupulosity is to wave it away, like Dylan Thomas in his Welshed-on outback or Theodore Roethke in his greenhouse, in Nihil Nosters like this one from Black Zodiac:

                        If I could slide into a deep sleep,

                        I could say—to myself, without speaking—why my words

                                    embarrass me.

 

                        Nothing regenerates us, or shapes us again from the dust.

                        Nothing whispers our name in the night.

                        Still, we must praise you, nothing,

                                                                         still must we call to you.

 

                        Our sin is a lack of transparency.

 

                        November is dark and doom-dangled,

                                                                                     fitful bone light.

                        And suppuration, worn wrack

                        In the trees, dog rot and dead leaves, watch where you’re

                                    going . . .

 

                        Illegibility. Dumb fingers from a far hand. . . .  

          One is either drawn to this sort of thing by encouraging one’s own self-transport to some likeness of the place Wright’s poem was called forth from, or left utterly cold by it. It is poetry that delights in hand-jiving the void and flaying all signative recognition to white light’s illegible bone. In a truly upending sense, it is Whitman’s Death, death, death, death, death etiolated to earth-wrack and warmed-over nihilism. O Walt, how plentiful the waxings waned in thy name; how unquenchable thy hymn to death on others’ lips.

 
C. K. Williams

C. K. Williams’s (b. 1936) poetry has proved very much an acquired taste which, to be honest, not many readers have labored all that intensively to acquire. His verse is problematic in a number of insoluble ways, not least of which being its insistence on being long in the shanks but short on vivifying implication and nuance. With this Williams at least, what you see—spread-eagled on the page and bearing an uncanny resemblance to the fourteeners of Arthur Golding (the Elizabethan translator, made much of by Pound, of Ovid’s Metamorphoses)—is what you get, his docket of themes a bill of particulars being as likely to put you on as explain at length how particulars all too often bill us. (Caveat to formalists: If Ashbery’s extra-long-line and margin-to-margin prose poems raise your hackles, the loose and baggy monster that is Williams’s prosody will decidedly not be your pekoe or camomile.) Actually, the concerns which propel this poet’s later verse to dizzying widths of script are broadly coterminous with what keeps it earthbound thematically, which is more often than not a Pinsky-like tropism toward the totems of the down and out—from oil-slicks to tattoos. That and a letch for noodling which is plainly more at home tinkering with corpses—metal ones—in New Jersey’s automobile graveyards than coring, say, Plato’s Timaeus in some remote corner of Cornfordville. Not that Williams is averse to playing the symposiast in company with such summarians of the cornswoggle as Windelband, Höffding, Marías, or Copleston. “The Gas Station,” perhaps his most signature composition, effects conjuration with names which usually only those who themselves possess comparable ones—like Theodor Adorno—can get away with brandishing like talismans: “This is before I’d read Nietzsche. Before Kant or Kierkegaard, even before Whitman and Yeats. /I don’t think there were three words in my head yet. I knew, perhaps, that I should suffer, /I can remember I almost cried for this or for that, nothing special, nothing to speak of. . . .” Williams’s poem seizes upon what is presumably an authorial experience, when quite young, with a prostitute—a collective experience—since it is one shared with adolescent friends.

      At the moment which reduces to a disarming nakedness the nucleus of its recollection, the poet and his friends are imprisoned in a car that is parked at a service station. They are waiting for one of their party to reappear from the restroom where he has gone to relieve himself in more than just the normal urinary way. “Because one of my friends, in the men’s room over there, has blue balls,” he writes, “He has to jerk off. I don’t know what that means, ‘blue balls,’ or why he has to do that, / it must be important to have to stop here after this long night, but I don’t ask.” The reader doesn’t need to be told how this “don’t ask, don’t tell” scenario came to unfold. As a mature and presumably sophisticated adult (which the teenagers undergoing the night’s initiation rite plainly are not), he has no trouble grasping the consternation shown by the speaker of the poem at being beset by two unassimilable agendas simultaneously. Clearly, the poet’s adolescent counter-self (in post-Socratic drag) is addressing us as ex officio spokesman for a group of ephebes (an unflattering designation but they certainly aren’t men) having been “serviced” by the same whore. The friend taking so long in the rest room has had to masturbate because the act of fellatio performed on all members of their party was phoned in by an exceptionally uncaring prostitute who disserviced one boy who was then left writhing with “blue balls” and having to bring to the point of culmination alone what hooker indifference to anything but the cash nexus either could not, or in the last extremity would not, finish off. The entire poem (whose material seems tailor-made for the T.A.’s fifty-minute hour) hinges, like others in the Williams oeuvre, upon the indissolubility of certain kinds of knowledge. Its soft center resonating with echoes which return to us, wafted on the wings of song or prayer, and haunting us not just with roads not taken, but with woods stopped by on snowy evenings when ramps, fatefully swerved onto, prove later to have been life-altering. “Freud, Marx, Fathers, tell me,” the voice of “The Gas Station”’s contrapasso pleads,

                                                                        what am I, doing this, telling

                                    this, on her, on myself,

                        hammering it down, cementing it, sealing it in, but a machine,

                                    too? Why am I doing this?

                        I still haven’t read Augustine. I don’t understand Chomsky that

                                    well. Should I?

                        My friend at last comes back. Maybe the right words were

                                    there all along. Complicity. Wonder.

                        How pure we were then, before Rimbaud, before Blake. Grace.

                                    Love. Take care of us. Please.  

     “The Gas Station,” then, and “Tar,” “It Is This Way with Men,” and perhaps “Alzheimer’s: The Wife”—in addition to, of course, all of Flesh and Blood (1987), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award—and Repair (2000), which is nearly as indispensable, leave us with the double helix of Williams’s unique genome pretty much in hand. How good is it all? Perhaps that’s a question inappropriately put to a canon like Williams’s, stubbornly remaining a body of work that must be allowed to open gradually for the individual reader, petal by petal, at rose-speed. Such poetry as is generated by C. K. Williams’s nitrogen cycle owes less to spreadsheeted chlorophyll counts than to the sort of elaborate wraparounds that share with string theory and déjà vu a common counter-clockwisedness. One thing is beyond argument: in the united states of Williams, it is decidedly not the economy, stupid.

 
Charles Simic

The fortunes of Charles Simic (b. 1938), like those of others in that age group having come up during the ‘60s and including figures like Diane Wakoski (b. 1937), James Welch (b. 1940), and James Tate (b. 1943), flickered bravely through the ‘70s, sputtered gamely in the ‘80s, and were more or less seen as having flatlined whether they did or not when the roll call of the ‘90s was finally taken. Consider them casualties of the Theory Wars, if you like; for though not all of them found the levelings of postmodernism hostile to their interests (Wakoski certainly didn’t), nor the rise of multiculturalism an impediment (Welch, a Native-American, assuredly did not), something clearly stalled, if was not actually derailed, in a number of careers whose morning line odds once signaled sure bets. Simic’s bona fides as a stand-up surrealist probably carried him further than others in this group, particularly since he tailored the taffy-pull of his psyche to an audience weaned on the European, rather than the plain vanilla American, version of the Breton lai. It wasn’t always so in Simic’s rather checkered personal history. Early poems like “Fork” demonstrate that in 1969, the year of Nixon’s volunteering for more kicking around by the national press, of percussive intrusions into Laos, and of Cheap Thrills courtesy of Janis, Simic was already marching to the beat of a drummer indifferent to all but the tattoo of Luis Buñuel:

                        This strange thing must have crept

                        Right out of hell.

                        It resembles a bird’s foot

                        Worn around the cannibal’s neck.

 

                        As you hold it in your hand,

                        As you stab with it into a piece of meat,

                        It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:

                        Its head which like your fist

                        Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.  

          Born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and not actually resident in the United States until 1948, Simic writes verse vividly recalling the German bombardment of his country and the civil war it unleashed. That, combined with the grisly Serbian folklore he was force-fed as a child, led him to conclude that the stuff of bad dreams he had thought traceable to fetors found only in eastern Europe were as harvestable on his adopted soil as the Pippins in apple pan dowdy. The Vietnam war then doing a number on the second country to give him shelter might not have been lobbing bombs into his own back yard but its remoteness in geographical terms did not hinder him, or that other refugee from his part of the world, Jerzy Kosinski, from darksiding the moon with postings from the void that would soon option Charles Manson and his bevy of bacchantes. Novels like The Painted Bird and Steps were then providing rock poets like Bob Dylan with the malaise and discomfort needed to repaint Grant Woods’s American Gothic in the stark new colors vocalized in “Desolation Row” and “Like a Rolling Stone.” In Simic’s verse the repressed didn’t just return, it marched belligerently into American living rooms demanding to know why food hadn’t been left out for it in the form of some fulsomely pulsing neck.  

          Helen Vendler, who is neither as a rule egregiously mistaken nor right against all odds, has somehow managed to nail Simic’s brand of disquietude with astonishing accuracy. In “A World of Foreboding,” a review of the poet’s two collections, The Book of Gods and Devils (1990) and Hotel Insomnia (1992), appearing in her book Soul Says: On Recent Poetry (1995), she identi-sketches him in these bold lines:

Charles Simic’s riddling poems, for all that they reproduce many things about his century (its wars, its cities, its eccentrics, and so on) in the end chiefly reproduce the Simic sieve—a sorting machine that selects phenomena that suit Simic’s totemic desire. There is no escape hatch in a Simic poem; you enter it and are a prisoner within its uncompromising and irremediable world. [. . .] Simic’s poems, even when they contain a narrative, can almost always be “folded back” into a visual cartoon accompanied by a caption. I say “cartoon” at this point rather than “emblem” because Simic is a master of the mixed style, with vulgarity cheek by jowl with sublimity. . . .  

      She then proceeds to the observation that Hotel Insomnia (whose poems are glosses on the various “boxes” constructed by the artist Joseph Cornell) “is more an evolving sequence than a collection of separate poems [. . . and what] makes it a sequence is the inscribing on every page without exception, of several words from the repeated epistemological master list [of words] that forms a backdrop to the whole. . . .” The eight master-headings under which these “repeated” words appear are: Closure, Menace, Home, Nature, Body, People, City, and Subhuman. The strong implication driving her analysis is that such encryptions have furnished Simic with the means to control the anarchic updrafts of terror threatening constantly to transform his theme park of horrors into the dingy-est ding-an-sich of secret nightmare ever to have its cover blown.  

          As a technique, this approach has proved a win-win one for Simic: unprocessed garbage in, elixir of processed garbage out, and all with the poet’s individual stamp on it, making it somehow more artful than awful—but just barely, like a signature soup can by Warhol that proves what’s in a name is more than just nominal. By such means Simic separates himself from his merely irrealistic or un-realistic contemporaries and emerges from the fray a genuine surrealist. Vendler is right to note that “the sardonically comic side of his nature alternates with the remorsely bleak” in his poetry. The discovery that to conflate the choleric, melancholic and sanguine humours is only to blacklight the unintentionally humorous is what makes Simic more than just one more Eichendorf dandling märchen on his knee. This acerbic Serb doesn’t settle for teasing the horrific from its lair, he puts it through a puckish, Till Eulenspiegel-like “sieve” (Vendler’s veridicalism) that strews double-handed germs of anxiety with the ambidexterity of a Johnny Appleseed sowing Winesaps and Red Delicious. The somewhat earlier poem “Classic Ballroom Dances” (1980) revealed a mellower Simic, one who not only had Terpsichorean blasts like (W. C.) Williams’s “The Kermess” and Roethke’s “My Papa’s Waltz” safely under his belt, but had by great labor run the gamut of boozy, swervy dance steps himself:

                         Grandmothers who wring the necks

                        Of chickens; old nuns

                        With names like Theresa, Marianne,

                        Who pull schoolboys by the ear;

 

                        The intricate steps of pickpockets

                        Working the crowd of the curious

                        At the scene of an accident; the slow shuffle

                        Of the evangelist with a sandwich board;

 

                        The hesitation of the early-morning customer

                        Peeking through the window grille

                        Of a pawnshop; the weave of a little kid

                        Who is walking to school with eyes closed;

 

                        And the ancient lovers, cheek to cheek,

                        On the dance floor of the Union Hall,

                        Where they also hold charity raffles

                        On rainy Monday nights of an eternal November.  

          Arguably, Simic’s game has improved markedly over the years. For one thing, he no longer lets minor shock effects disvalue his take on the American dream, having begun sometime around the early ‘80s to insist on a decidedly more catholic rosary of anomalies. “Head of a Doll,” from the tip of the dying millennium’s backside (1999), very nearly encroaches upon the “Hieronymo’s mad againe” territory seized by Paul Célan by converting the blood simple congealed within the Creeley stanza into its Doppelgänger alembic of Gnosticism re-buffed and re-Bosched:

                        Whose demon are you,

                        Whose god? I asked

                        Of the painted mouth

                        Half-buried in the sand.

 

                        A brooding gull

                        Made a brief assessment,

                        And tiptoed away

                        Nodding to himself.

 

                        At dusk a firefly or two

                        Dowsed its eye pits.

                        And later, toward midnight,

            I even heard mice.  

Though somewhat advanced in years to still be considered a “younger poet” (he’s 67), Simic remains a dangerous man to believe down for the count. He has proved more than once a Merlin of self-transformation, passing through the needle-eye of enough vanishing points to make even a Cocteau dizzy. But more importantly, he has outlasted most of his fraternity mates in the Deep Image brotherhood, and his ability to maintain stride no matter how soapy the causeway, looks fair to keep him at the head of the current quarter-horse pack, at least for a while longer.

 
Frank Bidart

The springiest thing about the art of Frank Bidart (b. 1939) is that being so much at variance with the droppings of other birds similarly wired, it is not easily pigeonholed. Hang it as one might, it simply won’t suffer its jersey to grace some sweaty movement’s locker room or tour bus. This might perhaps be due to Bidart’s never having been apprenticed to the Stanford Deli and its celebrated slice-and-dice maître d’hôtel, Yvor Winters. Or, like Jorie Graham (see below), to being impatient with verse either fashionably staid or just as fashionably unruly turned out by the yard everywhere one looks. However Bidart might’ve avoided the way of this particular flesh, there is a good chance that American poetry will someday be rewarded with a Collected Poems by this poet unlike any to have so far turned its face to the wind. For who but Bidart could successfully agglutinate the fissionable material that “Ellen West” (1977) is irradiated with and husband its critical mass just long enough for the core of its operatic melodrama a due voci to fireball on cue? Or glass-blow a snow globe like ”Another Life,” which plants JFK’s 1961 trip to Paris in hallucinatory soil so rich that it is impossible not to see prefigured in its coiled trope the future blight its lines inexorabilize? Bidart’s style is often described as heavily dependent on “cinematic montage” and on fragments kept from dissolving into sameness only by the buttressing effect of slim wedges of heterogeneity. Fond of typographic jumpstarts and barking block capitals out of Kenneth Patchen’s Journal of Albion Moonlight, Bidart can whipsaw from O’Hara-esque effusions to bleeding chunks of raw cliché offered with the cuff-shooting quand même of a Malko or Svetlanov polishing off a bonbon by Glazunov.  

          A lot of stuff happens in a Bidart poem but much of it remains hidden behind a swirl of signals tricked out in wimples and ruffs snagged from the best of school-of Michaux costumeries. Under an epigraph from Paul Valéry, “Another Life” bravely sets out, determined to somehow italicize itself into a Zen concentration appropriate to its tailgating frame-tale’s hairpin curves—

                        “—In a dream I never exactly dreamed,

                        but that is, somehow, the quintessence

                        of what I might have dreamed,

                                                                         Kennedy is in Paris

 

                        again; it’s ’61; once again

                        some new national life seems possible,

                        though desperately, I try to remain unduped,

                        even cynical . . .

                                                 He’s standing in an open car,

                        brilliantly lit, bright orange

                        next to a grey de Gaulle, and they stand

                        not far from me, slowly moving up the Champs Elysées . . . .  

—and ends entangled in a holoscene from which private dream cannot with any certainty be disengaged from public event:

                        —I turned, and turned, but now all that was left

                        was an enormous

                                                fresco; —on each side, the unreadable

                                                                                     fresco of my life. . .”  

      So the sausage of a Bidart poem blasts its containing membrane to bits, the resulting tatters having been unmasked as pieces of the sausage itself mirrored from the underside. The exploded membrane that appeared only to disappear, its forcemeat spurting every which way, is then seen (in retrospect) as the dot from which originated the big bang of Rimbaldian délire that provided us with the show we’ve just watched. When optimally choreographed, the sense of seeing a dream of some pièce de resistance walking materializes out of our assisting (as the French idiomatically put it) at a spectacle in which a delirium of sorts withers into its own truth, avoiding all taint of a moral tied with a neat gratulatory bow. Bidart and Jorie Graham clearly head a class of supreme wingers maximizing the possibilities of today’s “cinematic” poetry—and it’s hard to predict just where Bidart’s romance with the cutting room floor (not to mention its epos of Camp indulged and denied) will carry him next. To stay on top of Bidart’s unique gyrational act, we need to remain not just tuned but fine-tuned.

 
Robert Pinsky

Robert Pinsky (b. 1940)—is almost as well known as a translator of Dante as he is for being an original poet. Another alumnus of the Wintersian school of nail-biters, he has survived the slicer, having emerged from the experience, unlike Edgar Bowers, say, or Wesley Trimpi, with minimal scarring and, from the look of it, few permanent ill effects. Vengefully or reverently, he has enshrined the Svengali-like attractions of his one-time mentor (whom he characterizes, with some Freudian irony, as “the Old Man”) in a poem in which, as viva voce remembrancer, he reproduces verbatim Winters’s ritual introduction to his Stanford poetry seminar. The strainings, duly italicized, from “Peroration, Concerning Genius” (the XXth segment of a long poem titled “Essay on Psychiatrists”), are themselves worth retailing:

                                                . . . “I know why you are here.

 

           You are here to laugh. You have heard of a crazy

           Old man who believes that Robert Bridges

           Was a good poet; who believes that Fulke

 

Greville was a great poet, greater than Philip

Sidney; who believes that Shakespeare’s Sonnets

Are not all that they are cracked up to be. . . . Well,

 

I will tell you something: I will tell you

What this course is about. Sometime in the middle

Of the Eighteenth Century, along with the rise

 

Of capitalism and scientific method, the logical

Foundations of Western thought decayed and fell apart.

When they fell apart, poets were left

 

With emotions and experiences, and with no way

To examine them. At this time, poets and men

Of genius began to go mad. Gray went mad. Collins

 

Went mad. Kit Smart was mad. William Blake surely

Was a madman. Coleridge was a drug addict, with severe

Depression. My friend Hart Crane died mad. My friend

 

Ezra Pound is mad. But you will not go mad; you will

            grow up

To become happy, sentimental old college professors,

Because they were men of genius, and you

 

Are not; and the ideas which were vital

To them are mere amusements to you. I will not

Go mad, because I have understood these ideas. . . .”  

     Contrastingly, the Randall Jarrell portrait of Winters in conference with his sycophants appearing in “Fifty Years of American Poetry” is not at all like the portrait painted by Pinsky. In fact, his “parable” is almost the inverted anti-self of Pinsky’s breathless adulatio:

. . . These poets have met an enchanter who has said to them: You have all met an enchanter who has transformed you into obscure romantic animals, but you can become clear and classical and human again if you will only swallow these rules.” The poets swallow them and from that moment they are all Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a wax one; from that moment they wander, grave weighing shades, through a landscape each leaf of which rhyme and scans, and says softly: “And the moral of that is . . .”  

     In its own garrulous way, Pinsky’s self-indicting recollection (recalling the monologue skidded into on the witness stand by The Caine Mutiny’s Captain Queeg) remains the best sketch of “Winters the riveting delusionist” we have—truly a tour de force. For sheer quality of attainment it belongs next to that shimmering kaleidoscope slide, which, though now 20 years old, is for many Pinsky’s best work to date, “The Figured Wheel.” Sounding for all the world like something Allen Ginsberg put through a syllable grinder calibrated by Marianne Moore, this poem consists of 49 lines of irregular iambic hexameter assembling, under a brightly Chagalled exhibition-hall ceiling, themes which have yanked at the elbow of this poet for years. Among these are the ineludability of nihilism, the tendency of homo sapiens to keep nihilism at arm’s length despite its ineludability, and the power questions have of further deflecting, if not completely vanquishing, the destructive effects wielded by the grandiose answers they lead to. Pinsky’s “figured wheel” can be viewed as either the imago of answers masquerading as “whole World.com” or the “slouching toward Bethlehem” eidolon of “answerworld.2.” Either way, this Ferris-like rotator in ineluctably rolling on, pointlessly levels everything in its path and leaves obviated in its wake all meaningful life as we know it or imagine it. For Pinsky, the overarching feature of the wheel is this: in its indomitable rolling action it takes on accretively all myth systems, religions, and historicisms it passes over. More rapacious by far than even Howl’s Moloch, it is no mere dreidl of Moira but as the rota obligata of Ananke itself:

                                                                                                . . .

            The wheel as it turns goes on accreting ornaments,

            Scientists and artists festoon it from the grave with brilliant

 

            Toys and messages, jokes and zodiacs, tragedies conceived

            From among the dreams of the unemployed and the pampered,

            The listless and the tortured. It is hung with devices

            By dead masters who have survived by reducing themselves magically

 

            To tiny organisms, to wisps of matter, crumbs of soil.

            Bits of dry skin, microscopic flakes, which is why they are called “great,”

            In their humility that goes on celebrating the turning

            Of the wheel as it rolls unrelentingly over

 

            A cow plodding through car-traffic on a street in Iasi

            And over the haunts of Robert Pinsky’s mother and father

            And wife and children and his sweet self

            Which he hereby and unwillingly and inexpertly gives up, because it is

 

            There, figured and pre-figured in the nothing-transfiguring wheel.  

          The same bizarre amalgam of Lilliputian focus and Brobdingnagian depth of field occurs in shorter Pinsky poems also. Never one to squander question times on “What if's,” this poet likes to zero in on the ciphers (recognizably human, though denuded ontologically to Gordian naughts) prompting the discerning to prefer the query, “What about . . . ?” As is stressed (almost to the point of obsession) in “The Questions” (1983), such interpellations—always with respect to people—are as endemic to the autonomic nervous system as breathing:

                        What about the people who came to my father’s office

                        For hearing aid and glasses—chatting with him sometimes

 

                        A few extra minutes while I swept up in the back,

                        Addressed packages, cleaned the machines; if he was busy

 

                        I might sell them batteries, or tend to their questions: . . .  

     People—the gross generic rather than the collective mysterium from which census takers distill statistics—have for Pinsky remained too long the mere unempowered shadow-subjects of demagogues shuttling with evangelical impunity between the homologues pray and prey. While a “Poem About People” might never restore the pre-Enlightenment grace dispersed by that generic, Pinsky is betting that, if taken seriously, the pixel count of perception might be raised enough for the us not susceptible to being folded into we, the people to recapture that quotient of humanity long been absent from our field of vision. You know this monster most dear, O reader; it is the people, that flawed simulacrum of ourselves that would rather congregate en masse than commune darkly with its own navels; that prefers the transport of rock concerts and ball games to not driving others to distraction with unresolved needs of their own. Also—and this perhaps is what is most irremediably awful about this aggregate—its adsunt is not the result of some Intelligent Daseiner having dropped its singulars here (like the naturalized citizens of Zola’s Germinal or Farrell’s Studs Lonigan, for example), but are literally being spewed out everywhere to be run over, mangled, and crushed not by anything as cosmically elegant as a figured wheel but by a rota ordinaria no more intergalactic than the Spenglerian go-round writ no larger than the microdot from which we all sprang:

                        The jaunty crop-haired graying

                        Women in grocery stores,

                        Their clothes boyish and neat,

                        New mittens or clean sneakers,

 

                        Clean hands, hips not bad still,

                        Buying ice cream, steaks, soda,

                        Fresh melons and soap—or the big

                        Balding young men in work shoes

 

                        And green work pants, beer belly

                        And white T-shirt, the porky walk

                        Back to the truck, polite; possible

                        To feel briefly like Jesus,

 

                        A gust of diffuse tenderness

                        Crossing the dark spaces . . .  

This, then, just in: though lacking in the breadth—and depth—sufficient to land him in the class of an A. R. Ammons, Robert Pinsky appears to have carved a reasonably secure niche for himself among the better quality also-rans and reality-show survivors of American poetry’s own figured wheel. Not a bad thing, considering: others equally promising have, given comparably protracted careers, fared worse. The problem with Pinsky-style verse is that, while remaining distinct through its various devolutions, it never really evolves into that non pareil poets all crave but hardly ever produce. To sound more or less like one’s own age is, sad to say, to be left to resound, rather less than more, in others’.

 
Sharon Olds

One very much dislikes relegating a poet like Sharon Olds (b. 1942) to the heap of the second-rate, for plainly she deserves better, post-confessionalist leanings to the contrary notwithstanding. Unfortunately—and this should not be ignored or downplayed—many of her poems, fascinating as they appear, are not, strictly speaking, poetry at all. A hypostasis, or even a hologram of it, perhaps, but an eidolon, not the living, breathing thing itself. How, you ask, can something be a version of something without ultimately requiring to be judged as a version of that thing? Well, zebras are not, despite their equine attributes, horses; nor are tents houses, or soapbox derby vehicles automobiles. An Olds composition might look like a poem, read like a poem, invite judgment, positive or negative, and be given a pass as though it indeed were a poem, but still lack enough of what makes a poem truly one and not just a reasonable facsimile of it like the “prose poem,” the apothegm, or the purple aphorism when all the beans have been counted.  

      Even freakish genera can be induced to throw off diverting exceptions to their own rule, which might explain how the naturalistic yodel favored by Olds can be nudged and prodded until it yields up radiant deviations from poetry’s clutch-purse of norms. One such is “You Kindly,” which I hesitate to call a “love poem” because, as much as I am moved to be moved by it, I cannot certify it’s having met that faux-genre’s faux-requirement that the love-object of such a poem must appear as an actual individual. Love-objects may go unnamed—indeed, that is usually their fate; but the person in question, along with his or her personhood, should be conjurable beyond a separately hymnable clutch of limbs, organs, salivary glands, and nipples. True, the “you” referred to “kindly” in Olds’s poem does point to the poet’s own husband; yet there is little in Olds’s loving litany to confer real flesh on the disembodied and wispy him-ness therein rhapsodized.  

      A pity, because it is a rare thing in American writing today to come upon a woman’s paean to a sexual alter ego who is unequivocally male. We find such cropping up occasionally in Denise Levertov’s early verse and in the prose-poetry fantasias of Anaïs Nin, but in not many other places where the intent is not, at least on the surface, silkily pornographic. With an expediency bordering on genuine abandon, “You Kindly” makes its ascension to one-of-a-kind exceptionality from the very first of its 67 lines. So seamless in fact as a model of erotic bliss is it the sensual allure that it limns is scarcely dimmed by its reduction of male attractiveness to a handful of protruberantly tasty bits. Only cited in toto can “You, Kindly” be fully appreciated for what it is, but for the sake of even the modicum of erotogeneity that a potsherd of Olds is likely to arouse, its opening lines are cited below as an example of this poet’s ability to be shorthair-raisingly evocative without ever once being spurred to speak in poetry’s tongues:

                        Because I felt too weak to move

                        you kindly moved for me, kneeling

                        and turning, until you could take my breast-tip in the

                        socket of your lips, and my womb went down

                        on itself, drew sharply over and over

                        to its tightest shape, the way, when newborns

                        nurse, the fist of the uterus

                        with each, milk, tug, powerfully

                        shuts. . . .  

         Superb as this is, its “tug,” to borrow one of its own words, is unmistakably toward prose’s gravitational field rather than poetry’s. The latter rides to its realizations on the swiftest of steeds; Olds’s below-the-belt confessio reaches the hitching post of its transcendence in no more than a walk. Unfair? Okay—in an andante sure of its destination but heedless of delights that might strew its ambling path. It might be reverently observant of the feelings that brought it to the pitch of adoration, be even grateful for having glimpsed them; yet it seems no more concerned with who owns the zones being caressed than the point of view in any piece of soft porn might be.  

      And then, of course, there is the matter of Olds’s “tell it like it is”—well, matter. Confessional poets often bore because that is what people who go on interminably about their own troubled pasts invariably do. The last person to have written compulsively about himself without hopelessly boring his reader was Montaigne, and even he starts to pall when, having strapped on his rhetorical heels, the mountain outside his study window and his persona assume equal elevation. (Rousseau, too, could drop lids crashingly, a fact to which fact many in his time bore witness, whether having been present when he was doing his thing or merely gossiping about having learned it secondhand. Anyone doubting this can have their qualms quashed by reading his Confessions, a book that refutes for all time D. H. Lawrence’s injunction to always put one’s trust in the teller rather than his tale.)  

      Electra-complexed or not, Olds has always had much screaming to get off her chest, all of it sayable but frequently devoid of telling effect—at least not without issues of privacy and taste being raised which she herself might well broach given different circumstances. Like other “postconfessional” poets she doesn’t so much write out of calamitous experience as out of a need to write herself into it, to the point of clinical blowout, if need be. Still, we’re left with the nagging question: if whose need be—the reader’s, or just hers? Since the reader is not admitted to the consulting room he has to rely on the poet to present herself uncensored but tempered enough to commit her ideas and emotions to the refining fires of art rather than to the less fiery arts of refinement. The way of the latter leads directly to store-bought naturalism, self-immolation, and the therapeutics of shock, which is the same, I guess, as saying that Olds habitually favors the fiery arts over similitudes less warm to the touch. The aspersive paternal shadow cast in poems like “The Promise,” “The Glass,” “The Feelings,” “The Exact Moment of His Death,” “My Father Speaks to Me from the Dead,” and “Once” comes off in far too many poems as a literary property and not a crippling parental blight. For one thing, it is difficult to see the man infernalized in them having wrought the havoc that is attributed to him; the glowing mental and sexual health of the poet retrieving his shade from Hades rather compromises the testimony given. Such poems may invite the wrath of the politically correct but others, such as “You Kindly,” argue for greater caution in the wielding of “clinical” generalizations about the despoiling effect (short of actual molestation) “abusive” fathers can wreak upon their daughters’ sexual lives. More must be known about the susceptibility of individual women to such damage, which means that political capital should cease to flow from dissension sown among already overstressed combatants in the gender wars, and writers like Sharon Olds are in a good position to see at least some of these poisonous trends reversed.  

          But there are aspects of being catapulted into the maelstrom of a poet’s personal life that are more disturbing even than these. To start with—and it is for this reason that I flee the confessional when in range of the outpourings of a Gregory Orr, a Bruce Weigl, a Marilyn Hacker or a W. D. Erhart—confessionalism doesn’t just violate the lyric impulse, it does what can only be called a Sadean number on it. Which is why Olds too often impresses one as a Sexton lacking the single bell whose pealing tones can all but cover the raging multitude of sins confessionalist poets harp on. Anne Sexton—certainly no slouch at Walmarting the sexually unspeakable—managed when at her best to keep personal gossip and the lyric imperative sufficiently compartmentalized that the one was never allowed to wreak havoc on the other. She could grasp, in other words, what Olds, forever prone to ruckus and retribution, remains unable to implement beyond the crudest of fauvismes: the refusal of permissiveness that alone keeps the storm surge unleashed by open confession from battering the shoreline of those only too easily beset poetics of personal reconnaissance. Lyric poetry tells us, in language both memorable and personally involving, what it feels like to experience significant emotion from the inside. Confessional poetry, always on the other side of this, tries to clarify (to whom in particular—or for that matter in general—often being left hanging) what the experience, in whatever form it takes, means. And for no more ostensible reason than to register satisfaction at being the fount from which the blessings of meaning cracked open in this way flow. If the confessionalist impulse had no deeper source than “look at me, look at me,” it would create no more muddle in setting “sinners” off from the “sinned against” than did Wordsworth or Coleridge in writings each of them published after their entente of the Lyrical Ballads had run its course. The confessionalist muse does not pull up stakes when the literary sensibility is under pressure to withdraw so that pathologists properly equipped to arbitrate issues of life and death can weigh in on the side of good and plenty over and against the worse and not enough. No, it is precisely at such times that the confessionalist muse is about her business of warming the tub to ensure the swift emission of blood from the slashed wrists of those benighted enough to have wished for her intervention in their affairs. Not to put too fine a point on this, confessional poetry publicly re-privatizes public excoriation until it resembles emotional solvency. Is the result poetry? Leonard Cohen once jokingly remarked that writing was easy: all you had to do was sit down and open a vein. Was he really joking, or just pulling the leg of those prone to being fatuously over-serious? Either way, modern poetry has to center on more than just the world being kept alive by a dialysis machine making poets’ offal impurities go round. Otherwise, it is no more than a brief and abstract chronicle of organ damage wholly befitting the piss-poor time we live in.  

      Yet, how remote all this seems from the renally rich strains in which Sir Philip Sidney and poets of his kidney waxed apologetic. Attendant upon worlds much differently golden, their verse hewed to the uplifting while sensibly forgoing the arch; and, though beset by hell-hounds not easily distracted by a sop, their diurnal round may have been as replete as our own with means exceeded and lives lived griplessly end over end, but what a difference their day made to the standing of poets in general in that world!

Louise Glück

As shrewd a publicist for her own work as Sharon Olds, the irrepressible Louise Glück (b. 1943) has doggedly plied more or less the same millstream since 1968, keeping herself afloat while improving her skills at executing tricky moves without leaning out too far to either side. Her secret strategy—the half-smug, half-canny tack she persists in—seems rooted in the notion that in an age marred by over-production and under-achievement, the only mutually enriching commerce open to poets is the fostering of trade between sovereign states of the soul, and those of “I” and “myself” are as good as any with which to get the ball rolling. Certainly in Glück’s case, the melding of nominal and reflexive has proved a wise strategy indeed. 

Not so much in areas exclusive of career advancement, however. The last few decades have seen an enviable stock of preserves being put up by this poet, the chunky fruit of which, though enticing texturally, often consists of no more than half-ripened thoughts better slathered on issues of contemporary relevance than delighted in for its own sake. So useful in fact has this algorithm to enhance Glück’s feminist-individualist cachet become, that it would be as disingenuous for her to come out against poets who lint their own navels as it would be for those who salt mines to protest the commercial availability of gold dust. Glück’s admirers might well believe that “by screening personal experience through various forms of artifice, her poetry succeeds in bringing us close to piercing feelings of anguish, isolation, and loss”; others less smitten approach such claims with a grain of—well, salt. If anything in the flimflam world of the arts seems beyond question, runs a certain vein of common sense, it is that skepticism should prevail in the face of any kind of artifice which purports to be able to keep separate and apart feelings and things feelings want desperately to cling to. A venerable philosophical tradition teaches us to look upon artifice as an enchanter’s loop that can render subject to the most squamous of fatae morganae anything naïve enough to penetrate its magic circle. Its artful projections can quite convincingly replicate anguish, isolation, and even abjectly experienced loss—but only so long as, distracted by their “realism,” we ignore the shadows flickering darksomely on the funhouse walls of such empiricist palaces as Plato’s cave. Which is not to say that substance, or semblance of same, has been lacking in the veronicas executed by Glück in the bull ring, whether in the course of evading the promptitudes of disintegration that so blithely obsess her; or of exorcising marriages, literal and figurative, that limit her; or of flirting with defeat in this or that hog-wallow refusing to de-swine itself at the whim of this Circe of Circes. Too often, her tactic for staving off impermanence is to build bigger and better ephemera to keep mortality’s coils safely under lock and key. For a time in the ‘70s, she seemed set on turning the plight of children, sick, drowned, or otherwise lost to possibility into a slough of personal despond. Then, perhaps re-energized by the false spring promised by the Great Communicator, with its “aw, shucks” rictus of “it’s morning again in America,” Glück’s verse made a quite uncharacteristic lunge for the wild, the febrile, and the just plain bizarre. As though to cap years of patient waiting, Glück began lavishing whole magnums of shock and rage on inequities that one would have thought already strip-mined to the wall supports in postmodern poetry: togetherness (whether marital or just garden-variety sexual) racked by “the low, humiliating / premise of union—”; the always impending wrench of death—”I’ll tell you something: every day / people are dying. . .”; and personal misfortune, “to survive / as consciousness / buried in the dark earth,” comforted only by a knowledge that “whatever / returns from oblivion returns / to find a voice.” These devolutions into mantra, having advanced with radial force to the forefront of her verse, seemed under no obligation to heed sweet reason or anything reasonably humane. Yet even her detractors had to admit that, though her probings of the unconscionable smacked ever so slightly of exploitation, they did open up for exploration certain fields of dreams which the half-baked surrealists who colonized American poetry in the ‘60s left radically unplumbed.  

In somewhat later collections, her gorge may be seen rising over women trapped in roles specifically rigged to offset feminist victories (as in the often anthologized poem, “Palais des Arts”) and others routinely assigned lower berths in the sexual revolution’s Pullman cars (“Mock Orange”). To mark the final sloughing off of her long-nursed despondency Glück has the feminine persona of “Eros” recount a rosary of satisfactions achieved in bed before performing the reverse sacrament of removing her wedding ring. This is to experience the only grace modern woman disgraced by peremptory déshabille has left to her: to know undenuded nakedness as Eve knew it before the Fall:

                        I had drawn my chair to the hotel window, to watch the rain.

 

                        I was in a kind of dream or trance—

                        in love, and yet

                        I wanted nothing.

 

                        It seemed unnecessary to touch you, to see you again.

                        I wanted only this:

                        the room, the chair, the sound of the rain falling,

                        hour after hour, in the warmth of the spring night.

 

                        I needed nothing more; I was utterly sated.

                        My heart had become small; it took very little to fill it.

                        I watched the rain falling in heavy sheets over the darkened city—

 

                        You were not concerned; I could let you

                        live as you needed to live.

 

                        At dawn the rain abated. I did the things

                        one does in daylight, I acquitted myself,

                        but I moved like a sleepwalker.

 

                        It was enough and it no longer involved you.

                        A few days in a strange city.

                        A conversation, the touch of a hand.

                        And afterward, I took off my wedding ring.

 

                        That was what I wanted: to be naked. 

A typical sleight of the Glückische hand is to leave the prosodic plan of a poem vague until the final line or two, when the hidden agency of stress emerges from concealment to declare itself at last as an emphasis worthy of being made: That was what I wanted: to be naked. Note how the battery of five accentuals, as marmoreally audible as any hendecasyllabic swatch of Dante’s Commedia, establishes “Eros” in its bed of concupiscence, the abstraction of affection having been totally dissolved in tincture of Ewige Weiblichkeit. 

Glück reached another crisis point of sorts with The Seven Ages (2000). A block-or-tackle moment had been looming ever since same-old, same-old had become in the early ‘90s inadequate as efflorescence-maintenance and began to edge threateningly toward deliquescence. No poet, even one accustomed to squeals of enthusiasm for every verselet she publishes, is immune to the queasiness that wells up when poring over galleys that, year in and year out, sound distressingly like “The Empty Glass”:

            I asked for much; I received much.

            I asked for much; I received little, I received

            next to nothing.

 

            And between? A few umbrellas opened indoors.

            A pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table.

 

            O wrong, wrong—it was my nature. I was

            hard-hearted, remote. I was

            selfish, rigid to the point of tyranny.

 

            But I was always that person, even in early childhood.

            Small, dark-haired, dreaded by the other children.

            I never changed. Inside the glass, the abstract

            role of fortune turned

            from high to low overnight. . . . 

Whatever else this might be, it is not poetry; but because this kind of thing so often passes for poetry, a name ought to be attached to what it is, if only to keep critics who ought to know better from slumming in its local habitations and failing to downgrade them for the tourist traps they are.  

The meteoric nature of Glück’s poetic career has caused some critics to wonder why the work of a poet as modestly gifted as she should have been met with such an outpouring of praise, especially since her work has moved but fitfully from the schoolmarmish inflexibility of her earliest efforts to the supple particularization of experience minimally expected of mature stylists. If there were occasions on which attempts were made to shift the focus of her poetry toward more catholic convergences, Glück cannot be said to have recalibrated her perceptions to accommodate changes on the ground since early triumphs like “The Wound” (1969) inured her to breakouts into monotony and tonedeafness in her own writing. Some of her first poems (those just shy of juvenilia) had a “fare forward, voyager” aura about them, but then, so did a lot of student writing during the ‘60s. Parading her foibles with abandon, Glück gave promise of instructing the male chauvinist pigs of antediluvian pre-feminist times what it was like to be out-truffled by a miniskirt of consequence. And she did it with the class of a Barbara Guest, not the contumely-ridden brashness of a Marge Piercy. 

But even in heady times such as those, Glück could not resist the allure of being a women’s advocate hors-de-tutu and relentlessly au point. A typical case au point ? How about “Labor Day” (1969):

                        Requiring something lovely on his arm

                        Took me to Stamford, Connecticut, a quasi-farm,

                        His family’s; later picking up the mammoth

                        Girlfriend of Charlie, meanwhile trying to pawn me off

                        On some third guy also up for the weekend.

                        But Saturday we were still paired: spent

                        It sprawled across that sprawling acreage

                        Until the grass grew limp

                        With damp. Like me, Johnston-baby, I can still see

                        The pelted clover, burrs’ prickle fur and gorged

                        Pastures spewing infinite tiny bells. You pimp. 

Ah, for the squeakiness of springs less doctrinairely sprung!  

The double-edged sword that flashes when a Yale Younger Poet is named has been remarked on often enough, the cases of subsequent crashing-and-burning being thick enough on the ground to set anyone wondering whether even enough too soon is all that much for very long. Indeed, being singled out for this honor seems not a little like being born a Jew in America: learning early that the gift of Chosenness keeps on giving, one discovers too that the stipend dispensed is tied to expectations that leave the recipient staring down the gun barrel of what is at best a very mixed blessing. 

 

James Tate 

If anyone can attest to the pistol-whipping premature fame can administer to the young (and not very worldly wise) poet, it is James Tate (b. 1943). Having been at 23 the youngest candidate ever selected by the Yale Committee, Tate got to experience the lumps and bumps of exceptionality when barely past the age of consent. The collection that earned him his coveted prize, The Lost Pilot (1967), was unusual not alone for its subtly undergirding thematic—the trauma of having a airman-father lost in a bombing run over Germany the same year he came into the world—but for the way in which Tate used it to highlight, without actually talking about it, a war very much on the brink of expanding into a much larger conflict. Critics were not slow, however, in pointing to a number of glaring flaws in the book’s handling of its dissimulative subject matter. Some noted that its youthful author was perhaps too much taken with the flashbulb aperçu that made the “glimpse-poems” of W. C. Williams’s Spring and All (1923) so eye-catching, not to mention the patented send-up of wonder that made the “magnesium-flare” verse of Pablo Neruda a watchword for shock and awe, if of the pre-packaged kind. Though the contents of The Lost Pilot lay down a hedgerow of slickly foreshortened doubletakes, a few poems like “Sleeves” do double duty as nettles gracing a poisoned thorn bush of contumelies essentialized by Tate to a spate of folkways by, of, and for equal-opportunity hypocrites:

            The shadow of a bleeding

            defeated lion asleep

            beneath a cedar tree, still

 

            visibly afraid, confronts

            me. Or no, the way the eyes

            are locked reflects shame.

 

            He’s not what I had thought.

            This happens. I saw a brute

            at a party. He was going

 

            to lift a goddess of

            beauty with each glad hand.

            Prefatory entertainment:

 

            the bully blushed and prepared

            to flex his lauded arms, found

            his sleeves completely empty. 

            Later collections also drew fire down on Tate, mostly for the unwonted “zaniness” of his broadly zapping rhetoric and facile surrealism. Notwithstanding, he continued to emit swatches of verse at regular intervals, showing manfully that little toll was being taken on his time or talent by having to trade precious writing stints for the financial pittance teaching undergraduates threw his way. The most notable success among his early poems is probably “The Wheelchair Butterfly,” a piece which deserves entombment in a time capsule for its title alone. Setting the tone for much of his later work, this homage to the synapse gratuite thrusts American surrealism-lite as far into the reason-deprivation tank of Deep Image as Breton-ese poetry is likely to get:

                        Yesterday was warm. Today a butterfly froze

                        in midair; and was plucked like a grape

                        by a child who swore he could take care

 

                        of it. O confident city where

                        the seeds of poppies pass for carfare,

 

                        where the ordinary hornets in a human’s heart

                        may slumber and snore, where bifocals bulge

 

                        in an orange garage of daydreams,

                        we wait in our loose attics for a new season

 

                        as if for an ice-cream truck.

                        An Indian pony crosses the plains

                        whispering Sanskrit prayers to a crater of fleas.

                        Honeysuckle says: I thought I could swim. . . . 

            By 1978, the redacted version of The Lost Pilot’s title poem showed continued sluicing toward a distinctly Eluardian floodplain: the relatively placid brooks and streams which had dotted Tate’s early to mid-’70s verse were swapped not just for whitewater, but for rapids as sheer and perilous as could be negotiated without incurring mayday. Gone, too, was the relatively inhibited manner of “Stray Animals” and “The Blue Booby” and in its place appeared an idiom that functioned like the thinnest of membranes separating the possibility of horror from its awfulest realization. Thus, “Intimidations of an Autobiography” (1978) and “The Motorcyclists” (1983) avoid self-puncturing explicitness quite marvelously. It is as if the poet were equipped with intravenous radar that could remain differentially attuned to the clotted rhythms and open-ended fermatas by which madness is simulated by artists who might’ve felt something of its downdraft but know little of its centrifugal pull as the realest of surreal things.  

           Yet despite much audible gear-grinding, nothing very new or interesting marks these mid-career sonatas for defibrillator and kazoo, though by now the stress of meeting publishers’ and tenure committees’ demands for more of the traumaturgy which had made The Lost Pilot magical was beginning to create lines of its own—on the poet’s once youthful-looking face. Forced to meet deadlines with readymade collages like “Moisture spreads across my pillow, / a chunk of quartz thirsts / to abandon my brain trust,” and having to accept from the inspiration mill such run-on bits of improv as “Where Babies Come From” (about which the less said the better), the question was batted around whether the lost pilot in Tate’s legendarium had been replaced by an automatic one. The jaw-dropping gift he’s once shown for corner-shot ballistics seemed to have morphed into the sort of pool-player’s fade that rather than clearing table after table, off-angled cue balls to send them and not target balls careening into the pocket. 

            A shame really, because back when Tate had a pro’s control his game had something the majority of neo-surrealist clones he’d thrown in all too clearly lacked. If it was visible in only somewhat less than half of his published verse, it still marked him as a stylist light years ahead of the “Hello Dali’s” bringing up his rear. In recent years his poems have almost begun to sing again, but there is an ever-present rasp, a decided hoarseness to their lilt and cadence. It seems ages since Dudley Fitts wrote of the prodigious hopeful of The Lost Pilot:

. . . What emerges finally is a body of young poetry, utterly new—James Tate sounds to me like no one I have ever read—, utterly confident, with an effortless elegance of control, both in diction and in composition, that would be rare in a poet of any age and that is particularly impressive in a first book. I do not know who taught him to sing such songs. . . . 

            One further ominous (but not, one hopes, terminal) note: It augurs poorly for Tate’s Hall of Fame prospects that, despite several collections brought out in recent years, the second edition of J. D. McClatchy’s influential The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry (2003), has dropped him from its roster of poets. Not that McClatchy has a direct pipeline to posterity, but as of this moment, the morning-line odds on Tate no longer augur for him a second noon. 

 

Yusef Komunyakaa 

Yusef Komunyakaa (b. 1947) has to be viewed, no matter what one’s standards for thoroughbreds, as not just a horse of a different color but as of a class of zebras utterly foreign to reviewers used to staggering stereoptically between hip-hop black and an only marginally less trendy off-white. Among the most startling ones to appear since Rimbaud hung up his chops and made off to lay groundwork for the rape of Darfur in Abyssinia, Komunyakaa, like Tate before him, sounds like no poet anyone has heard or heard of; and no other poet is likely to begin sounding like him so long as “sound” and “like” stay as cleft-palatably disjunct from one another as string-theoretical universes with only a black hole in common. Jahan Ramazani, editor of The Norton Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry sums up just what it is that makes Komunyakaa’s verse as eminently pronounceable as his surname is not:

Komunyakaa’s poetry also cuts across different levels of diction, from biblical idiom to journalistic reportage. African American vernacular to high-art lyricism. Komunyakaa’s remark in Callaloo about Melvin Tolson applies with equal force to his own work: “he brings together the street as well as the highly literary into a single poetic context in ways where the two don’t even seem to exhibit division—it’s all one and the same.” Syncopating short, jagged lines, emjambing and coiling syntax, building musical resonances through assonance and alliteration, Komunyakaa crafts poems that have mannered elaborations of jazz improvisation, in the long tradition of African American poets who have mined jazz and the blues for poetry, from Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown to Gwendolyn Brooks and Robert Hayden, Amiri Baraka and Michael S. Harper. 

            Given the glut of computer-savvy poets roaming the Intel-4 pampas, it’s refreshing to find at least one capable of lithographing the stone age of our current vulnerability in terms beyond those of clip art—as is made poignantly evident in this poet’s “My Father’s Love Letters”—with an acetylene torch, no less:

                        On Fridays he’d open a can of Jax

                        After coming home from the mill,

                        & ask me to write a letter to my mother

                        Who sent postcards of desert flowers

                        Taller than men. He would beg,

                        Promising to never beat her

                        Again. Somehow I was happy

                        She had gone, & sometimes wanted

                        To slip in a reminder how Mary Lou

                        Williams’s “Polka Dots and Moonbeams”

                        Never made the swelling go down.

                        His carpenter’s apron always bulged

                        With old nails, a claw hammer

                        Looped at his side & extension cords

                        Coiled around his feet,

                        Words rolled from under the pressure

                        Of my ballpoint: Love,

                        Baby, Honey, Please.

                        We sat in the quiet brutality

                        Of voltage meters & pipe threaders,

                        Lost between sentences . . . 

What’s hard to believe is that this four-stress line, with beats as solidly studded as though an electric-powered nail driver had riveted them in place, is nearly identical to the one T. S. Eliot used to such powerful effect in Four Quartets. And like that elder modernist, Komunyakaa refuses to acknowledge that such a perfect rhythm for rolling experiences out of memory’s garage on nearly silent wheels should be put up on blocks and allowed to molder there. Why retire a fit and appropriate verse technique when it took centuries to evolve its like and there is no shortage of purposes which such a delivery system can serve?  

Like Bruce Weigl, Komunyakaa seemed almost to have sprung fully formed as a war poet. Having experienced the militant infantilisms of the Vietnam years from the below-curb-level viewpoint of the underclass, he went on from there to obsess about the elaborate booby-trappings of post-traumatic stress (set to randomly explode like shells in defective metal jackets) and how, when conditions are right, they might flower into bullet-poems as efficient in reaching their targets as poems like “Camouflaging the Chimera” prove:

            We tied branches to our helmets.

            We painted our faces and rifles

            with mud from a riverbank,

 

            blades of grass hung from the pockets

            of our tiger suits. We wove

            ourselves into the terrain,

            content to be a hummingbird’s target.

 

            We hugged bamboo & leaned

            against a breeze off the river,

            slow-dragging with ghosts

 

            from Saigon to Bangkok,

            with women left in doorways

            reaching in from America.

            We aimed at dark-hearted songbirds. . . . 

           “Facing It” and “Tu Do Street” lug (in different hands) unlightenable combat baggage to the furthest extremities of purgation, the ballast of their imagery rendered less burdensome only by the weight dropped through time passing and the marking of such transits by the shed light of radium dials casting war in half-life. But there is more rattling around Komunyakaa’s poetic quiver than an arrow or two of shame leaning against a few others of deliverance. Returning home to a less exotic hell than Quang Tre or Khe Sanh, Komunyakaa graduated from memorial reflections on dead Vietnam war buddies to sit-ins in catacombs where only goddesses of the dead call the roll. The ritualized momentousness suspended in his “Día de los Muertos” must be, one can’t help but conclude, closer to the poet’s own hearth gods than to any local spirits left to stew in Southeast Asia. These, though recallable through nightmare in borrowed flesh, lack imprimatur to release anyone from the underworld which they carved from driftwood left by Marx, Machiavelli, and Malraux:

                        Terra cotta shrines for loved ones

                        Who died to hurt us. We rehearse

                        Their tunes & display their favorite

                        Colors in a labyrinth of unwinding rooms

 

                        Through inner sancta where baroque

                        Gargoyles open their eyes to scare away

                        Evil. Plaster of Paris

                        & papier-mâché dusted with glitter.

 

                        We season The Last Supper

                        With salt brushed from bodies

                        Temporal & unreliable as amaranth

                        Scenting The Mission District.

 

                        Halloween skeletons earn the weight

                        Of ivory & façade, resting

                        Like some beautiful accident

                        On a dice maker’s workbench. 

 

Carolyn Forché 

Transitioning from Yusef Komunyakaa’s poetry to Carolyn Forché’s (b.1950) is like shifting from war burdens trundled from left brain to right to plastic explosives being transferred, with excruciating care, from one hand to another. Each of these two poets has acquired a feel over time for the particular volatility of his or her gelignite—cerebral or hand-held—and has learned how to keep it sealed from the air and cushioned from sudden movement. Forché’s fulminating mix, leaning analytically towards the sexual and political, the gender-honed sticking points of America’s dark side, works exteriorly by focusing on occasions for violence without. Komunyakaa’s, on the other hand, is quite differently calibrated. Sinking an implosive probe into the dead center of American culture, it brings up on a screen of words an emblem of the sort of violence that is bottled up within. 

Forché’s rocket-ride to the ethereal of really high profile began, like James Tate’s, with her being elected to the company of Yale Younger Poets for Gathering the Tribes (1976). And like several such laureates, she broke chrysalis as a shatterer of complacencies, an articulate causative with rebelliousness to share. Evincing disdain for any poetic role exchanging quietude and acquiescence for speedy career advancement made her an inveterate polarizer of unopposed oppositions and someone who would try to disrupt business-as-usual wherever she saw it insinuating itself into literary affairs. This proved unfortunate in the sense that by the mid-’70s, she had become ripe pickings for every huckster of left-wing causes able to coax her name onto a petition, manifesto, or sign-up sheet for bodies to fill out a demonstration or protest march. At a time when looking grubby was still in among ‘60s refugees and refuseniks of various stamps, even her quietly restrained, Lord-and-Taylor-casual way of dressing drew comment, not a little of it unfavorable. The well-scrubbed look that came west with her from Bowling Green State University (her first academic job) to assume her first tenure-track position at San Diego State University—in tandem with the demeanor of a sweet and amiable young scholar not on the make—did not really jibe with the take-no-prisoners, post-colonialist stance she projected in the classroom. Nor did it coincide with the third world-sensitive persona endlessly professing solidarity with the oppressed trotted out in her poetry. Too fresh-faced and girlish to be a credible subversive and not nearly fractious enough to be the armature of rupture her strident vocalics aimed at, Forché seemed a poseuse stranded pathetically between a crock and a hard place set for her at a feminist table d’haute chosen for rather than by her. 

All of this, it should be emphasized, reflects my own personal recollection of having briefly had Carolyn Forché as a colleague in that time and in that place which was hard for more than just the young, the radical, and the poetical. While prepared to grant that the whirr of decades might’ve softened and smoothed out some of the more stubborn creases in my recollection, I stand by my characterization of her as a most ebullient and evanescent contradiction in terms. I might also stress that, barring a same-sex interlude or two in Gathering the Tribes, the feminism embraced in Forché’s first book in no way resembles the strung-out butcheries of a Valerie Solanis or the “all-holes-barred since all intercourse is rape” hysterics that earned Andrea Dworkin a podium on National Public Radio and NOW conventions everywhere. Generally speaking, Forché’s intra-feminine solidarity was of a piece with herself as a person: it was tolerant of a multitude of lifestyles and was no more attracted to agitprop extremism than Isabel Allende’s in her novels or Anaïs Nin’s in those dreams of worlds never grasped she called “diaries.” 

Somewhat later, though, in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s mostly, her airbrushed radicalism took on something of a flinty sharpness not detectable before. A stint with Amnesty International in El Salvador in 1978-80 resulted in a Lamont Poetry Award for her collection The Country Between Us (1981), but not much followed that, at least not in the way of original verse. Her time was largely divided between translation projects (mostly involving Hispanic women poets of strong leftist persuasion) and political engagements that hatched into memoir-producing trips to hot spots like Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Kosovo, all of which served to transform her into the nearest facsimile of Rosa Luxemburg America could fashion without itself turning into Weimar Germany. As her cachet as a liberationist ideologue spiked, her image as a poetic conveyor belt for ideas beyond the pale of UNICEF or of the World Feminist Alliance dimmed to an unhealthy pallor. Despite stints heading up international Writers for Freedom forums, she more and more came to seem a spent force with much of her best writing behind her. All that notwithstanding, there is little in the politically conscious verse of this country which has the soft-spoken power of the much-anthologized elegy, “The Memory of Elena.” Its control of tremolando effects may seem less prodigious in certain European or Latin American poetry but it is rarer than eyebrows on eggs in verse as programmatically uncosmopolitan and chez-nous as our own. Note how the unraised voice of the poem’s last three stanzas manages to speak volumes about untoward noises without ever rising to so much as a hint of stentorian sprechstimme:

                        As she talks, the hollow

                        clopping of a horse, the sound

                        of bones touched together.

                        The paella comes, a bed of rice

                        and camarones, fingers and shells,

                        the lips of those whose lips

                        have been removed, mussels

                        the soft blue of a leg socket.

 

                        But this is not paella, this is what

                        has become of those who remained

                        in Buenos Aires. This is the ring

                        of a rifle report on the stones,

                        her hand over her mouth,

                        her husband falling against her.

 

                        These are the flowers we bought

                        this morning, the dahlias tossed

                        on his grave and bells

                        waiting with their tongues cut out

                        for this particular silence. 

            Restraint like this seems couched in the genes of its very language which whispers of hands in the sotto voce of fingers first forced into a fist and then finding absolution in unclenching and eliciting beautiful sounds from a guitar. Forché might all along have wanted to breathe the fire of revolutionaries, but her talent was always more like Hemingway’s: one that breathed easiest and best when all the firebrands had slipped away and become as remote as the smoke and tears of what they had made and made occur. Whatever else this poet might write in times to come, and however much it might serve to muddy the waters, Gathering the Tribes will always be there to turn back what harvests dirt and make those waters clean and clear again. It’s that kind of book.

Charles Bernstein 

Of the so-called L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets (and the redoubtable Charles Bernstein [b. 1950] in particular) there is little to be said that others less charitable than I haven’t said already; and since none of it seems to have been in the least effective in making t=h=e=m go away, I’ll make this assessment mercifully short. The undampable simmer of retro-politics in American universities since the ‘60s and ‘70s keeps this particular pot of message amply supplied with kettles to call black and rag dolls of bourgeoisification to smash against treasured memories of the Berlin wall. The complexity of theories spun in movement anthologies such as Bernstein’s Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word (1998) notwithstanding, the rationale undergirding L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry is not that hard to toss into its own cocked hat, as it were. 

Among the multifarious demonic powers called upon by American imperialism to do its bidding, these poets claim, is the ability to employ media whose molestation of public discourse is so egregious and corrupt that only language translated back into L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (i.e., discourse properly detoxified) can restore sanity and good faith to the commonweal. The whole harebrained enterprise (whose assumptions closely resemble those endorsed by post-Marxian “New Historicists” of whose probity there is neither new or historical) is summarily executed in Bernstein’s poem, “Have Pen, Will Travel”:

                        It’s not my 

                        business to describe 

                        anything. The only 

                        report is the 

                        discharge of 

                        words called 

                        to account for 

                        their slurs. 

                        A séance of sorts— 

                        or transport into 

                        that nether that 

                        refuses measure. 

            And on that note of declining measure, l suggest we nod in condolence and move swiftly on. 

            As unnecessary as it might seem to ask (so ubiquitous has the phenomenon become): Has anybody not noticed how long poetic lines have gotten to be these days, from the now fashionable “prose poem” first hung out to dry by Baudelaire, all the way to that counter-metric more extreme than even Whitman’s, himself a bard whose take on prosody seemed coined by the respiratory system? I’m referring here to those emphatically non-metrical and even rickety verse contraptions favored by John Ashbery (in his Tatlin-esque moments), or by Susan Howe or Alice Notley (in their Gatling-esque moments). I am not, please note, including C. K. Williams in any of this, a poet whose fourteeners not only foster sensible prosody but make head-clearing prosodic sense. 

             Of late it appears that a full-fledged and even harmoniously arrived at modus vivendi has been hammered out between two erstwhile hostile poetic camps, and we now have a chance to determine not just how current poetry should sound but how it might look as copy in sight of eternity either hard or soft. The “unending design” of “epic” works like the Cantos of Pound, Williams’s Paterson, and Olson’s Maximus long ago broke the mould of the poem readable in one sitting that Edgar Allan Poe declared de rigueur, and experiments to further loosen the “formalities of form” by the New York School, the joint-Black Mountain-and-Projectivist conclaves, and the freer-than-free associations of vers librists in synch with the iso-metricalities laid down in W. C. Williams’s Paterson V and the “variable foot” triadics of Desert Music, Pictures from Bruegel, and Journey to Love (not to mention comparable poets with “populist leanings” such as James and Charles Wright, Robert Pinsky, and yes, C. K. Williams) effectively moved the goal posts of the American verse further and further downfield until what constituted a touchdown in contemporary poetry became just about anybody’s guess.

Jorie Graham

One might be tempted to add Jorie Graham’s (b. 1950) name to this list, were she sufficiently “populist” in either leanings or practice to accommodate herself to any such facile pigeonholing. Fronting an enormous ambition to restore high modernist drama—and daring (if not the methods that go with that tendency)—to American prosody, Graham has progressed relentlessly from the rigid paradigmatics of Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts (1974) to the sprawling and open-toed syntagmatics of her more recent collections, Regions of Unlikeness and Materialism. And all without much nostalgia being expended on the stiff-necked, rolling-deck walks of their predecessor, now a relatively distant memory. 

Graham’s first poems were musical almost to a fault, obsessing on minute extensions of assonantal patterns in repetitive, almost bulbous stanza forms. (Believe it or not, it is possible to be too concerned with musical rightness and consistency, to be so preoccupied with balancing soughing vowels and coughing dactyls that the point is reached where meaning and continuity collapse into nuclei of pure sound possessing neither atomic weight nor specific gravity. None of this, of course, should ever be confused with the transit of a typical poem by, say, Mallarmé, where sound and sense are absorbed quite seamlessly into an organum of evocations perfectly attuned to its own otherworldly woofers and tweeters.) Note, for example, how the serpentine of indents concaving Graham’s “Reading Plato” provides contour for the short “i”s undulating through the poem’s first stanza:

                        This is the story

                        of a beautiful

                        lie, what slips

                         through my fingers,

                        your fingers. It’s winter,

                         it’s far

 

                        in the lifespan

                         of man. . . . 

            Or, with even greater ingenuity, how the interleaving of vowel sounds blocks out almost every other sound that might threaten to obtrude in “Tennessee June”:

                        The is the heat that seeks the flaw in everything

                        and loves the flaw.

                        Nothing is heavier than its spirit,

                        nothing more landlocked than the body within it.

                        Its daylilies grow overnight, our lawns

                        bare, then falsely gay, then bare again. Imagine

                        your mind wandering without its logic,

                        your body the sides of a riverbed giving in . . . . 

            Some few years later, Graham was still using the paneled-indent stanza form (by 1980 it had almost assumed in her verse the eminence of a double helix); but she was also drifting toward a more tightly corseted thematics, as in the much anthologized “Luca Signorelli’s Resurrection of the Body,” from Erosion:

                        See how they hurry

                         to enter

                        their bodies,

                         these spirits.

                        Is it better, flesh,

                         that they

 

                        should hurry so?

                         From above

                        the green-winged angels

                         blare down

                        trumpets and light. But

                         they don’t care,

 

                        they hurry to congregate,

                         they hurry

                        into speech, until

                         it’s a marketplace,

                        it is humanity. . . . 

            Prepared to risk adverse response from readers holding that poetry is poetry, art criticism art criticism, and never the twain shall meet, Graham refused to cave in to the counterview that verse exhibiting writerly concern with sculpture and painting reeked not only of Richard Wilbur but of an “arch-poetry,” deveined, eviscerated and pseudo-Gothicized by “art” (as opposed to art). She pressed on with her agenda of linking contemporary poetry up with its endangered modernist future, gliding with pronounced slither toward what is now the hallmark of her poetics: a line broken into elisive units by such cinematic techniques as frame-riffling and compound montage, while being open enough in its tensile adhesions to remain nearly ajar. 

            Among the most remarkable of her efforts along these lines is “Fission,” which crosscuts the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 with the poet’s own personal memories of the movie theater in which, with house lights on, what had just happened in Dallas was announced by the management to the audience. Odd details abound in this recollection, such as the continued running of the feature attraction on the screen behind the visibly trembling theater representative who was breaking news having already been fractured by such as Walter Cronkite of CBS News into a thousand razor-sharp slivers:           

                                                                                              . . .

                                    Tick. It is 1963. The idea of history is being

                        Outmaneuvered.

                                    So that as the houselights come on—midscene—

                        not quite killing the picture which keeps flowing beneath,

 

                                    a man comes running down the aisle

                        asking for our attention—

                                    Ladies and Gentlemen.

                        I watch the houselights lap against the other light—the tunnel

                                    Of image-making dots licking the white sheet awake—

                        A man, a girl, her desperate mother—daisies growing in the

                                                                                                            corner— 

            By the time Graham’s poem begins, its final descent into a vortically controlled tailspin is prefigured by gyres of suggestiveness that widen notably with every new line. Its recurrent dream, double-exposed as nightmare, is developed in situ to a nicety of near-Sartrean imprecision. Little is left to the imagination that the event with all its historic resonance has not sifted with nugget-laden ore:

                                                                                                . . .

                        and aimlessly—what we call free—there

 

                        the immobilism sets in,

                                    the being-in-place more alive than the being,

                        my father sobbing beside me, the man on the stage

                                    screaming, the woman behind us starting to

 

                        pray;

                                    the immobilism, the being-in-place more alive than

 

                        the being,

                                    the squad car now faintly visible on the screen

                        starting the chase up,

                                    all over my countenance,

                        the velvet armrest at my fingers, the dollar bill

 

                        in my hand,

                                    choice the thing that wrecks the sensuous here the glorious

                                                                                                                        here—

 

                        that wrecks the beauty,

                                    choice the move that rips the wrappings of light, the

                                                                                    ever tighter wrappings

 

                        of the layers of the

                                    real: what is, what also is, what might be that is,

                        what could have been that is, what

                                    might have been that is, what I say that is,

                        what the words say that,

                                    what you imagine the words say that is—Don’t move, don’t

 

                        wreck the shroud—don’t move— 

            If to some it is offensive to see quoted at length what is deplorable straight up, I can only justify citing this much of the poem by saying that to give away any less of how it ends would be to deny it its rightful propensity to sprawl lengthwise as far as it can and breadth-wise as much as it must. What is truly remarkable about it—irrespective of how appealing it might or might not seem as a poem—is its licentious, Rite of Spring musicality. Graham’s cinematic compost manages its frenetic rhythms with brilliance, and the manner in which it keeps to its own wildly disparate and metrically disjunctive time signatures is nothing short of astounding. On record as seeking in her poems “new strategies to by which to resist closure [and its] suction . . . ; [new] forms of delay, digression, side-motions,” Graham goes out of her way to repudiate the armamentarium of reaction uniformly held to by the “strong measures” crowd. Way out beyond Robert Duncan’s and John Ashbery’s “opening of the field” (while not spurning artfulness and discipline), Graham has consistently kept her eye fixed on a field she has herself devised. It is not just ajar but agape at the possibilities a genuinely revitalized American poetry can look forward to. Far from achieving renewal, the present so-called “renascence” in this country’s verse is one that is doubled over with cant and literally gasping for fresh airs. Graham would let open field running in poetry truly be open field running and let policing of the game take care of itself. 

 

Gjertrud Schnackenberg 

Though as different from a Jorie Graham as any contemporary of that poet could be, Gjertrud Schnackenberg (b. 1953) is also not averse to donning a historical shift every now and then and slumming in neighborhoods that, though traditionally erudite, seem to many to be of less than desirable reputability. When this poet does venture out into such places, her sallies are often carapaced with shards of circumstance whose origins in one or another kinds of literature mock the seriousness of the very Fukuyama-like inevitabilities her poetry seems to be forefronting. “Darwin in 1881,” for instance, compares the Beagle’s near-death voyager-in-chief to Shakespeare’s Prospero “back in his bedroom / In Milan, with all his miracles / Reduced to sailors’ tales,” while at the other end of the island, the much lengthier (18 pages) “Imaginary Prisons—A version of Sleeping Beauty” could almost pass as a sequel to the Donald Barthelme redaction of the Grimms-and-Disney fabula, Snow White (1966), straitened and relaced, rather tersely, into a corselet of, well—tercets. The effect of the latter is not unlike that of Ashbery’s Girls on the Run (1998), which retooled a book written for pre-ingénues with Harry Potter-like pop-ups coached clinically by Abraham Mazlow. 

If history these days is everyone’s bête noire, the King Kong-like misadventures it can incur are in Schnackenberg’s view better steam-pressed into crumps and tucks of irony than teased with in-creasing horror. From her angle of vision the Pandora’s box heedlessly rifled by historians (and historicists) may be filled past crimping with rank and filicidal schmerzerei, but there’s barely a chronicle this side of the Rwandan massacre or the Holocaust without its light-filled moments, even if the source of the gleam is the scholarly auras objets d’art take on as their cultural radiance fades out. This might serve to explain why so little of Schnackenberg goes for some readers such a very long way. Other recent poets have been obsessed with history (consider Joseph Brodsky); but they have not deliquesced it down to the fine powder of illuminated manuscripts or the Bayeux tapestry made exhibit-fodder for a fund raiser’s traveling museum. Schnackenberg sifts the past with an eye to redivining its hidden portents, but often the game and its Colbert Report-like snidenesses go awry. What should bite like Swift merely gums its way through the self-effacings of satire: the bromides are those of Pangloss all right, but the Pangloss is not the Leibnizian monstrosity decanted by Voltaire, he’s the dumbed-down resideratum of Leonard Bernstein’s Candide. If the objections most readers take to entrails, tea leaves, or even scallopings on shells cast up by the sea being remain largely negotiable if they’re “read” in the right kind of poem (James Merrill’s poetic career didn’t entirely tank after Changing Light at Sandover), some line should be insisted on between one that eeks while remaining more or less medium-rare and the bifteck tartare of high-culture that is more than an FDA inspection or two past its shelf-life. 

True, as a poet of that kidney Schnackenberg wears her learning lightly—that is to say, with little of the dry-as-dust academicism that seizes an Edgar Bowers or a Geoffrey Hill when the conceit leaves the page and walks abroad as the conceited. What is more important is that she can almost instinctively sense when the bulldog grip exerted on a subject will yield debentures of consistency and when only dividends of laceration are to be expected. Consider, for example, the second of two poems bearing identical titles, “At Dante’s Tomb,” which are part of a twenty-poem sequence titled “A Gilded Lapse of Time (Ravenna).” This twelve-line completion of a diptych follows immediately upon another, somewhat lengthier excursus numbered “10,” which provides a personalized preamble to its second panel. The shorter of the two lyrics doesn’t in the least compound or build upon the tablature set by the preceding poem but instead treats its inscription as something to be overwritten by a palimpsest or pentimento that will ultimately make true what was before merely accurate at best:

            In English world is an isolated sound,

            Which an unmistakable, audible, inward whirl,

            Tilted on a hum that rhymes with itself,

            Revolving when we speak it, then ceasing to spin.

            We may founder before it, stranded before the page

            Where we gaze at it from above,

            Though if we say worldworldworldworldworld

            We can begin to feel it spinning around

            Its axis, then brake to a halt

            When we turn our attention away. You believed

            We intuit the sound of the spheres, Dante,

            When God touches our ears. Ephphatha. Be thou opened. 

            In “10,” Schnackenberg seems content to number the spores feasting on her own pilgrimage’s minutiae, as though to convey the dank immemoriability of the tomb were enough to count, as it were, the constitutive fungi of spirituality’s mildew. In “11,” however, Schnackenberg broaches the mundus of the Commedia itself, from above as well as from within. Keeping an ear out for what Dante might have imagined he was hearing as he tracked his persona through the triune realms of the afterlife, she attempts to pin down just what sort of ethereal sound a soul, triply brushed by wings of the eternal, might emit. Might not such a sound have been the one Dante labored to capture from deep within the grooves of terza rima, the verse form which, for him, best preserved the mysterium of the joyously grave lying just this side of the Holy Trinity’s “Three in One, One in Three”? 

            An obsession with nuance of this sort is what broadly characterizes the miniaturist, though Schnackenberg, in poems like her own impressive tribute to the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam (murdered, like so many other notables of the Bolshevist era, by Stalin and his thugs), “A Monument in Utopia,” is not at all your everyday pieceworker given to ransacking the diminutive for snippets of the muse’s largesse. This work, over 30 pages long and among the least rhythmically stilted or constricted of all her poems, is also the most intricately structured of all the pieces gathered in Supernatural Love: Poems 1976-1992 (2000). Readers intent on sampling what is best in Schnackenberg are well advised to reach for it first. Not only do its Escher sketches of fact perspectivally melding with conjectural fissure reflect how webs spun of art, reportage, and journalistic commentary are woven over the centuries, but it manages also to encapsulate through a series of calculated explosions (and lesser episodic flares) how manuscripts, suddenly springing to life, spontaneously combust their own illuminative radiance. 

            Still, in all candor it must be admitted there is little in the entire Schnackenberg oeuvre that seems either genuinely original or of lasting value. As verse, it runs technical circles around much of the competition; but as poetry its circlings of historic anguish, rodomontade, and angst fail repeatedly to penetrate to the deepest maleboges of the postmodern sensibility. 

 

Mark Doty

Mark Doty (b. 1953), also born just after mid-century, shows fair to be among the most not merely gifted but gift-giving poets of his generation. His meteoric rise during the ‘90s graced an interregnum which, for all its puerile talk of “slams,” Billy Collins, and an unprecedented “poetry revival,” was as parched for real vitality as any since the late middles ages or, to borrow a phrase from the late W. K. Chambers, “the Drab Age.” Like Thom Gunn, a part of the post-Stonewall renaissance that, along with the feminist movement and the trans-ethnic, black-and-brown resurgence, has been about reconfiguring the whole of the American canon, Doty has shrewdly chosen to hitch his wagon to neither the shooting star of explicitly gay themes nor the falling one of gay subculture in excelsis. His poems stay nitpickingly clear of both patronizing gentrification and epicene double-downing on territory that was once belonged strictly to the Quentin Crisps, maintaining rather an uncompromising elegance within a relatively cologne-free zone of forthrightness and vernacular ease. Moreover, they seem so comfortable with their own unpuffed-out chests, and so utterly unstraitjacketed by artistic compacts imposing either formal restraint or rhythmic constipation, that they roll trippingly off the tongue (in the manner recommended to the players by Hamlet) rather than trip rollingly around it like arch phrases in the mouth of such as Carl Phillips. 

              Though not one to plant both feet, or even one, on turf claimed by rhymers and metricists, Doty enjoys reveling in the dopamine-like capacity of words to get human beings over the autistic hump preventing them from communicating freely with others. Realizing (perhaps from early personal unpleasantness) that, lacking an algorithm to help them advance from bud to blossom, the insecure and hesitant invariably presume life’s default setting to be “outer indifference necessitating inner silence.” Doty’s verse works overtime to expose how false the underwriting for this impression almost always proves to be. Like Montaigne—and Whitman—he considers nothing human to be foreign to him, not so much as a green crab’s shell. “Imagine breathing,” he writes, “surrounded by / the brilliant rinse / of summer’s firmament.” What his multitudes-containing self proposes, his lithe and agile poetry enthusiastically disposes. 

             His first two volumes of verse, Turtle, Swan (1987) and Bethlehem in Broad Daylight (1991), broke little new ground but proved nonetheless attractive showcases for a talent unwilling to rest on the laurels that dangle from key chains. Indeed, from the vantage point of seven books having been rung up rather than just two, the early poems seem no more than wanly circumspect fly-castings, their overreaching idiom that of a poet more intent on carving his way through a wilderness than finding it among sand traps and stones. 

            My Alexandria (1992) was the pivot that tilted all that false starting back to a more promising Square One, and coasting confidently on the praise it conferred, Doty found himself heir to the kind of apparency that only poets that cop prizes like the British T. S. Eliot Award can enjoy. But honors of that magnitude—and we’ve been there several times before in this survey—bring with them crushing pressure to ravel out strings of sequels while avoiding bad reviews at any cost. The safest thing to do in situations like that is spread one’s efforts as thinly as possible and hope that stylistic regularity will settle in before the reverse cachet of having been opening act for some greater draw blows one out of the water professionally. Best in show so far as My Alexandria is concerned are its two lengthiest pieces “The Wings” and “With Animals,” which extend with subtly subtensive metaphors the feel Doty has for the zoological as a logic extending considerably further than the purview of zoos. 

              “The Wings,” with its intricate draping of Rilkean folds, begins with a description of an auction at which the poet as a boy acquires a book and his parents a pair of snowshoes. He is given them (with retrospective precocity, they remind him of “angels’ wings”) to carry on his back, and this casual event becomes in later life an Icarian crux for some rather high-flying thoughts about innocence, vulnerability, and the danger of leaving a sense of both behind. On one occasion, the poet speaks of fashioning an angel

            like those Arcimboldos where the human profile

            is all berry and leaf,

 

            the specific character of bloom

            assembled into an overriding form . . . . 

—while on another, with the time-frame leaping forward from childhood to adulthood, he holds forth as mentor-remembrancer instructing students in a class of his how to fashion an angel seen as:

                                                            that form

                       

between us and the unthinkable,

                        that face we give the empty ringing,

                        and how that form for me appears in a boy

                        with snowshoe wings slung across his shoulders. 

            The unpacking of this morality play concludes affectingly with an italicized envoi in which the poet (now grown into an accomplished pedagogue) leaves his students in possession of a burden miraculously weightless, “willing around you, hard, / the encompassing wings of the one called / unharmed”:

                        A steady fine-pointed rain’s

                        etching the new plantings,

                        and I’m making the rain

                        of the angel. Try to be certain,

 

                        he says, where you’re looking.

                        If you’re offered endlessness,

                        don’t do anything differently. The rule

                        of earth is attachment:

 

                        here what can’t be held

                        is. You die by dying

                        into what matters, which will kill you,

                        but first it’ll be enough. Or more than that:

 

                        your story, which you have worn away

                        as you shaped it,

                        which has become itself

                        as it has disappeared. 

            As shapely as these poems are, Doty’s true voice did not effectively emerge until My Alexandria (1993) and Atlantis (1995), the pair of collections in which his early tendency to play it safe is finally deep-sixed and the confident poet, until then forcibly submerged, races triumphantly to the surface. From their medley of spring and autumnal tunes sprang the even more robustly meditative branles of Sweet Machine (1998), Source (2001), and last year’s School of the Arts. In each of these collections Doty embraces a variety of forms whose rhythmic flexibility is not so much that of stanzaic structures as of pulsing arterials ensuring ease of flow and proper circulation of poetic plasma to where it is needed most. How might a legitimately American poetic voice sound in our time? Very much, I am on the way to being convinced, like this:

                        Of course I know how it ends.

                        I know there’s a precise limit

 

                        where salt marsh gives way

                        to fogged water’s steel.

 

                        But from here, from moor’s edge

                        where the tide pond

 

                        doubles the swallows,

                        it doesn’t seem to;

 

                        blond acres

                        vanish at the rim

 

                        into the void,

                        a page on which anything

 

                        might be written,

                        though nothing is. What I love

 

                        is trying to see

                        the furthest grassy extreme,

 

                        that fog-marbled horizontal . . .

                        Rippling strokes, a few high dunes

 

                        hung on the edges of the page

                        like Chinese brushstrokes,

 

                        barely there, and out

                        on the far shore

 

                        the sea gone, a clouded mint

                        gone without edges, horizon erased

 

                        a single silken exhalation

                        the color of mown grass,

 

                        unripe persimmon, gooseberry,

                        juniper, sage, green shadow

 

                        in the hollow of collarbone,

                        love, I know, it ends,

 

                        you don’t have to remind me,

                        though it seems a field

 

                        of endless jade. 

Slice it any way you like, but that is poetry—if not for all time, then certainly for this time. And why shouldn’t that be satisfactory until such time as posterity sees fit to dispose things differently? If Mark Doty’s, or some other poet’s version of Ammons-esque artspeech should become the default style for the next 40 years of American poetry—our version of Augustan rock-firmness with a Creeley or a Doty as its Oliver Goldsmith if not Samuel Johnson—I for one would see no cause for despair over where our literature was headed. Compositions like “Jade” (a segment of “Fog Argument”) remain, like that poem’s title, timeless, fathomless, and most honorific of all, vanityless creations. Today’s poets no longer need to show their creative-writing prowess by turning out villanelles or rondeaux or pastourelles to order. And the last poet writing in English who used rhyme consistently while saying something significant at the same time was probably William Butler Yeats. (Auden could riff well enough in that argot, but his changes were always a problem: when tenable, they were often unoriginal, and when original, they were like as not untenable.) 

It’s no use pretending any longer that the age of Ransom, Tate, and the early Lowell will magically reconstitute itself in some renaissance of right-thinking artisans with a Byzantine’s love of tile, symbolism, and the Sainted Sophia. I personally feel (and I know I’m not alone in this) a certain queasiness when confronted by contemporary poems that rhyme or laid out in neatly ranged stanzas harking back to, at the very latest, Thomas Hardy and the Georgians of pre-World War I Vaughan-Williamsland. The hottest quote making the circuit right now (it even adorned the back cover of the September 2005 issue of Poetry) is by Michael Hofmann, author of Behind the Lines: Pieces on Writing and Pictures (2001), who recently said of poetry: “‘I, too, dislike it,’ are the immortal beginning words of Marianne Moore’s poem ‘Poetry,’ and they seem to me to be the only possible credentials for a poet and a reader of poetry. I sometimes wonder if there are any poets who ‘like’ it, and whether I would like them.” 

I don’t know that I would follow Hofmann all the way to Mooreish disdain of the glories of Old Castile and the train that made El Cid the Little Engine That Could. My dis-”like” of the short-winded in literature extends only to stuff of recent vintage that houghs-and-poughs its identity crises in curios of the pseudo-archaic which quite unaccountably still win approval from critics and reviewers who must know better if not that which is good. I have no objection whatever to poetry that rhymes or is laid out in “traditional” forms, provided that these attributes jibe with a historical context that validates them beyond any silly “biological” rationales often proposed today based on nothing less flimsy than misapplied notions of how heartbeats, walking rhythms, and respiratory exhalations subsume poetic conventions. Of late, such backflushing of history has rendered protractive an adolescent romanticizing of “tradition” well into middle age and beyond. In fact, so extreme in its totterage has this counter-counterculture become that, though it might fantasize taking all poetry with it when it goes, there is small chance of that happening in either this life or the next. Imagining virile returns to atavism can be amusing in a mordantly benign kind of way, but such games have clearly outstayed their welcome, outlived their usefulness, and outlasted their own loss-leader appeal as elitist anomalies. Not only does today’s pseudo-classicism not know what it is, it doesn’t even trouble to think whether the prospective readers it exists for themselves exist, and it doesn’t care. It’s a cottage industry that survives as a protectorate of the creative writing establishment and the publishing industry, and it will not of its own volition cease producing cheese until the downgrading of happy cows establishes itself as a priority with more than just the producers of skim-milk. A thriving national poetry should be held up as an indispensable resource, but poetry is becoming increasingly lost to us because the powers that be are far too dependent on cleaning up from, rather than after, the tidal wave of emulation attendant upon the second childhood of W. H. Auden and the groundless investiture of Billy Collins. Finally—and this is addressed to those who might’ve been made angry by what they’ve just read—please refrain from holding up “alternative” anthologies like Douglas Messerli’s From the Other Side of the Century (1991) as proof of how third- and fourth-generation Olson- and Antin-ites have trashed all hope of a respectable American canon. As bad as writers like Robert Grenier, Ray Dipalma, Alan Davies, Diane Ward, Joan Retallack, Peter Inman, and other avant-garde “retros” who appear convinced that mouthing off and having the runs are cut from the same expressive cloth might be, they are no worse, and certainly no more hazardous to American poetry’s health, than the retro-retro bunch that can not only not shoot straight but cannot imagine the jerseys of such as Messrs. Nemerov, Hecht, and Meredith being retired ever. 

It took the combined genius of an Ammons, a Creeley, and an Ashbery to prove that the future of post-Modernist (not postmodern) poetry lay not in the well-crafted singlet or individual masterpiece (as fine and desirable as these might’ve once seemed), but rather in the sustainable idiom of rhythmically heightened speech that over time and across space could elevate all that it touched to perdurable sublimity. Sublimity of that sort would enter our lives as part of a collective monologue whose in medias res we could choose either to tap into from book to book or leave decidedly alone. If we did elect to open ourselves to its “field,” to paraphrase Robert Duncan, it would envelop us, as does Whitman’s best barbaric yawps, with a deeper and more subtly interfused sense of how verve and congeniality might merge inflectively with a species of serious talk that might well send text messaging and other grotesqueries of the brain’s bicameral alternations back to the nerd drawing boards from whence their binarism came.  

But enough of that. Young American poets need to return, and soon, to the business of nurturing responsibly what is worth the trouble of saying and leaving what is not to cultural moguls splendidly equipped to deal in pulp. Not what masters like Hart Crane, or W. H. Auden, or Richard Wilbur have already framed for display in those poetic museums called anthologies, but what constitutes their own best shots at getting our poetry right. We can only hope that the now emerging younger successors of the Mark Dotys, having learned from the Ammonses and Snyders and Creeleys what poetry can do as well as be, will continue going about the business of taking care of business in just that way. 

Finally, there are all the poets, legitimate as well as pretenders to grace, not dealt with in this survey. No opinions of standing or status or should be read into their exclusion; nor should anything be made of most of the poets discussed here belonging to that most vilified and libeled group, white males. I could have gone out of my way to include more women, more African-, Latino-, and Native-American poets. And then I could have counted them into slots until I had arrived at a suitable demographic replica of the last American census. I chose not to do that and I make no apologies for it. Like Randall Jarrell’s honorees of 1962, my “division champions,” though no more equivalent in “rank” or ability than his, each poet merits, whatever his or her deficiencies, a place on the poetic all-star team for the period covered. This judgment is not exclusively mine, for I have in no instance seized upon a poet whose work is not represented in at least three current anthologies of record. Those left out have been excluded for reasons of space alone. Though I could perhaps have devoted space to more poets of deserved repute—the Richard Howards, the Marilyn Hackers, the AI’s, the Leslie Marmon Silkos, the Rita Doves, the Louise Erdriches, the Henri Coles (the list could go on almost indefinitely)—I concluded that such small beer as I could reserve for names off my primary list would seem flatter and more drained of flavor than my honest confession that the boat could only hold so many and a number of exclusions, unpopular in certain quarters, would have to be made. And so they were. But now that the reader has had a chance to acquaint himself with the reasons for the choices thus made, he or she is free, indeed encouraged, to come up with a short list of his or her own.

Back in 1952, in his brief handbook The Background of Modern Poetry, J. Isaacs took to task the Jarrellian approach to reducing huge historical slices of the history of poetry to “winners and losers.” A meaningful history had to fill in those blanks in the record that account for broad sweeps in the three “T”s—taste, tone, and technique—that haven’t yet made it into the textbooks.

What do we mean by the real history of literature? First of all, by literature one means, of course, poetry, and its real history can only be established by separating “poetry” from the poets. Most histories of poetry are just a chronological sequence of accounts of individual poets. What we need is perspective rather than chronology, based on what was really happening in poetry itself, rather than in certain prominent and successful poets—a history of the turf rather than of winners only, of consumers rather than producers. We need a history of the struggle rather than the achievements, of the process of English poetry as seen by the reading public, and by poets struggling for the glory and dignity of their craft. Literary history is ruthless towards the unsuccessful. I think the poetry of our time will have an advantage in the textbooks of the future, because we are so much more aware of what has been going on, and we have preserved the records of our bewilderment and our debates where previous ages have let them vanish. 

I don’t know that I would be quite so sanguine about the poetic security of our own future, lagging a half-century beyond Isaacs’s rose-colored retrospect, but I do hope, sometime in the not too distant future, to give what he suggests a try—that is to say, attempt a “history of the turf” of recent American poetry, of its consumers and not just its major producers. Is such a “perspective based on what was really happening in poetry itself” still feasible? The prospects for corralling that “really” any time soon seem problematic at best, so all I can say for the time being is: watch this space.
