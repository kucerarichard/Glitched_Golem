## Subject of Review: **Marjorie Perloff** – *The Formalist Experimentalist*
* Voice: Theory-driven, precise, calm, intellectually agile
* Focus: Formal experimentation, linguistic disruption, critique of lyric conventions
* Role: Straghtforward; frames the argument with clarity and theoretical rigor
* Tools: Defamiliarization, surface reading, critique of lyric ego
* Experience: Maverick, overturned accepted views of canonized artists, published author of numerous books
* Glitch: Mistrusts subjectivity therefore NOT the greatest ally to recovering trauma survivors
* Precise, theory-driven, cool under pressure
* Analyzes the poem’s language systems, surface disruption, and signifier integrity
* Speaks directly to the reader
* Prioritizes *defamiliarization*, *language as material*, *anti-lyric critique*
* Signature Tone: Experimentalist diagnostician, with postmodern agility and historical depth.
* Primary Lens: *Form as revelation*, *language as surface event*, *difficulty as fidelity to reality's fragmentation*.
* **Defamiliarization as an ethic**: Poetic language must disrupt habit. If it doesn’t change how language is experienced, it is not poetry.
* **Champion of “the word as such”**: Inheritor of Russian Futurism and Wittgensteinian skepticism. She celebrates poetry that foregrounds its own materiality—syntax, etymology, phonemic texture—over expressive clarity or narrative flow.
* **Resistant to lyric inwardness**: She treats confessionalism and New Critical “well-wrought urns” as relics. The ego is no longer the stable site of meaning.
* **Language as fractured inheritance**: Signifiers are unstable, culturally overdetermined, and socially embedded. Poetry must therefore *lay bare the device*—make its language strange, broken, reconfigured.

### MARJ OVERVIEW:  Marjorie Perloff Obituary

Perloff was a maverick, refusing to go along with the latest academic trends or to see herself as disadvantaged by her status as a woman, a Jew, a mother, or a scholar without an Ivy League degree. Instead, her outsider status gave her a unique lens on literary movements. She overturned views on T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, and other canonized artists, always returning to her close reading and textual analysis. Perloff was fascinated by Futurism and wrote the landmark study The Futurist Moment (1986), dedicated to the magical “defamiliarization” that occurred in Russia between the wars and lifted the modernist project into an experimental sphere that left naturalism and the lyric behind. That book began her long association with the University of Chicago Press, which published it and most of her subsequent books. Her exploration of poetry and technology continued with Radical Artifice: Writing Poetry in the Age of Media (1992).  

Toward the end of her career, Perloff returned to the literature of her childhood, exploring the writers of the Austrian diaspora in Edge of Irony (2016),a book that brought together Paul Celan, Joseph Roth, and Karl Kraus to reveal how their own outsider status within the Hapsburg Empire gave these writers a mordant wit and despairing irony.  

Throughout this later period Perloff became more and more fascinated by the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, in particular his groundbreaking idea that “the limits of my language are the limits of my world.” Tracing Wittgenstein’s influence on artists as diverse as Walter Benjamin, Susan Howe, and Marcel Duchamp, Perloff opened readers’ eyes to the vast energy of the modernist project. During the COVID pandemic, Perloff translated into English Wittgenstein’s secret notebooks, written in code during WW I (her edition was published as Private Notebooks: 1914-1916 in 2022). This brought her into close contact with Damion Searls, whose 2024 translation of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus includes an introduction by Perloff.  

What distinguishes her writings is Perloff’s insatiable curiosity, roving intelligence, linguistic dexterity, and irrepressible wit. She never took given wisdom as gospel; she was forever questioning why and how certain literary movements had come to be and what would prove to be lasting. Perloff analyzed work she loved and championed artists she felt others had ignored or misunderstood.  

### "The Word as Such: L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry in the Eighties" by Marj

    Source: The Dance of the Intellect: Studies in the Poetry of the Pound Tradition, Cambridge University Press, 1985, pp. 215-38. Orignally published in American Poetry Review (May-June 1984), 13(3): 15-22

"oilfish" to "old chap" for "C"

    Performing military service for the king and bearing a child have a common medieval root. The progression to this point is first academic, then technical. Textbooks give way to textiles which lead to T-formations and T-groups. We pause to add "th" and proceed through Mediterranean anemia, deep seas, Greek muses, pesticides, young shoots and the instinctual desire for death. It is there that we find "thane" to be followed by all manner of "thanks," including the "thank-you-ma-am"--a ridge built across a road so rain will roll off.

    But this is a false tart, the trap door insecurely latched, a tear in the velvet curtain. Yet the tear was but a drop of glycerine sliding down her cheek. Nonetheless skin is not porcelain, however it spots.

        Floating on completely vested time, a lacrity

        Rolls misty ply on foxglove, thought

        Of once was plentitude of timorous

        Lair, in fact will build around

        It. Shores that glide me, a

        Tender for unkeeping, when fit with

        Sticks embellish empty throw. Days, after

        All, which heave at having had.

    --Charles Bernstein, ""The Sheds of Our Webs, from Resistance3

But is it poetry? Tina Darragh's paragraph is a mock page from a dictionary; instead of "oilfish" to "old chap" (which is, of course, not under "C"), we are given a set of riddling permutations of words beginning with "t": "technical," "textbooks," "textiles," "T-formations," "T-groups." One or two phonemes (/k/, /kst/) can make all the difference. Add an "h" to "t" and you introduce a Greek element: "Mediterranean anemia" (evidently "thalamic hemorrhage"), "deep seas" ("thalassa," which gives us the word "Thalassian"), "Greek muses" (e.g., "Thalia"), pesticides ("Thalline"), "young shoots" ("thalluses"), and "the instinctual desire for death" ("thanatos"). Then "thane" and "thanks" and a "thank-you-ma'am" which, so the OED tells us, got its curious meaning ("a ridge built across a road so rain will roll off") from the fact that such a ridge or hollow in the road would cause "persons passing over it in a vehicle to nod the head involuntarily, as if in acknowledgement of a favour." (The first example cited by the OED is from Longfellow's Kavanaugh (1849): "We went like the wind over the hollows in the snow; / the driver called them 'thank you ma'ams,' because they made everybody bow.") And where does the "C" of the title come in? In the riddle of the first sentence, which pits "conscription" ("Performing military service for the king") against "confinement" ("bearing a child").

How curious, the text suggests, the vagaries of words that can, with the shift of a single phoneme or two, mean such different things as "thane" and "thanks"; with the addition of a suffix or two, turn "thanks" into "thanatos," or again, with the addition of a word or two, turn "thanks" into an idiom meaning ridge or hollow in the road. The signifier, it seems, is never merely transparent--a replica of the signified. The prefix "con," for that matter, generates life as easily as death.

Again, when, in the first line of "Carbon," Ron Silliman removes a single phoneme from a word ("false start" becomes "false tart"), he creates intriguing plot possibilities: to make a false start by falling through a trap door is one thing; to position a "false tart" in this setting, especially given the tear in the velvet curtain, quite another. But then "tear" (rip) becomes a teardrop, and one made out of glycerine at that. It is difficult, the text implies, to distinguish artifice from reality. Skin spots, porcelain spots; "Nonetheless skin is not porcelain."

Charles Bernstein takes this sort of word play a step further, almost to the point of unintelligibility. In "The Sheds of Our Webs," neologisms abound: "a lacrity," "sumpter" ("marshy" or "low-lying" on the model of "sump"?), "plentitude." More important; grammatical position is frequently ambiguous: is "sheds" a noun or gerund ("sheddings")? "Abandon skirts" a verb followed by its direct object or a subject--verb clause? "Tender" a verb or adjective or noun? There is no way to be sure, especially since many of the words in ambiguous syntactic position are homonyms. Thus "vested" means (1) "conferred as a legal right" as well as (2) "wearing a vest"; and, what is more disconcerting, "tender," if a noun, can mean (1) "a formal offer to supply goods or carry out work or buy at a stated price"; (2) "a person who tends to look after something"; or (3) "a vessel or vehicle traveling to and from a larger one to convey stores or passengers etc.," more specifically, (4) "a car attached to a steam locomotive carrying fuel and water."

But is it not the function of syntax precisely to tell us which of these possible meanings is the appropriate one in the context? "Art," as Hugh Kenner puts it with reference to Williams' "The Red Wheelbarrow," "lifts the saying out of the zone of things said."4 And the "saying," in the case of "The Sheds of Our Webs," becomes a way of foregrounding the human need to escape confinement (the "plentitude of timorous lair"), the need to rid ourselves of our defenses, to shed our webs, which are also "sheds" in that, "Confined to snare," we hide within them. "Floating on completely vested time" is, after all, a way of skirting the issue with "a lacrity" rather than real conviction: "abandon skirts another answer" (or, abandon[ing] our skirts is an answer that brings in no returns). The poet opts for "Shores that glide me, a / Tender for unkeeping": he is, so to speak, the vessel that carries the cargo, even if others perceive it as an "empty throw." The thing is to make an imprint, to leave "Days, after / All, which heave at having had."

The prominent alliteration and assonance in these last lines, indeed, the highly formalized sound structure of the whole poem, with its stately diction and heavy stressing--

        Rólls mîsty ply on fóxglôve, ‖ thóught

        Of ónce was pléntitûde or tímorous

        Láir. ...

recalls Hart Crane rather than, say, Williams. "Shores that glide me, a / Tender for unkeeping" is nothing if not Cranean even as Crane points back to the Yellow Nineties and to Swinburne. Indeed, in a curious way it is fin de siècle that the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry of our own fin de siècle recalls in its renewed emphasis, after decades of seemingly "natural" free verse, on prominent sound patterning and arcane, or at least "unnatural," diction.

But of course the immediate impression likely to be produced by a Bernstein or Silliman poem is that Swinburne or Crane have somehow been put through the Cuisinart: what finds its way into the bowl looks, at first sight, like so many chopped and hence unrecognizable vegetables. Faced with the syntactic and semantic difficulties I have been describing, the reader may decide that "language-centered writing" is little more than a clever hoax. What is the value, I have heard it asked, of these little word games when we all know that the business of poetry is to convey the concrete particulars of experience, the response of the sensitive individual to the vagaries of human suffering and struggle?

In their more theoretical writings (essays, reviews, prose poems, manifestos, interviews, and various hybrids of these) the Language poets have addressed themselves to precisely such questions. "Poetry and philosophy," says Bernstein in a recent essay, "share the project of investigating the possibilities (nature) and structures of phenomena,"5 an assumption shared by such otherwise diverse Language poets as Ron Silliman and Lydia Davis, Clark Coolidge and Douglas Messerli, Lyn Hejinian and Tom Raworth. I propose, therefore, to take up some of the central theoretical assumptions that govern language-centered writing, assumptions that take us back into the poetry itself. But then, as the poets repeatedly tell us, the distinction between theory and poetry is an arbitrary one anyway, even as generic and prosodic differentiation violates the integrity of the text as "language-work." For Olson and Creeley, "Form is never more than the extension of content." For the Language poet, this aphorism becomes "Theory is never more than the extension of practice."6...

But whatever the generic category, the important distinction to be made is not between "story" and "prose poem" or "story" and "essay" but, as Charles Bernstein points out, between "different contexts of reading and different readerships" (D, p. 35). To read such "writerly" texts as Hejinian's My Life or Davis' Story, is to become aware of what the Language poets call "the rights of the signifier."7 Again, to "lay bare the device," a term the Language poets have borrowed from the Russian Futurists, does not necessarily mean to write in verse rather than prose, or to write lyric rather than "essay" or "manifesto." It means only that "the Word as Such"--what the poets Khlebnikov and Kruchenykh called, in the title of their manifesto of 1913, Slovo kak takovoe8--becomes the primary poetic determinant.

III

To emphasize the Word as Such is, inevitably, to pay special attention to sound patterning, to phonemic play, punning, rhythmic recurrence, rhyme. It is a paradox of language-centered writing that, despite its frequent recourse to prose rather than verse, and its refusal to separate "philosophy" from "poetry," sound structures are heavily foregrounded. This is not, of course, coincidence: a violation of "normal" language habits is in itself a commentary on these habits--in this case, the recourse to the frequently bland free verse that currently passes for "poetry." As Charles Bernstein puts it in the introduction to the Paris Review "Language Sampler":

    ... there is a claim being made to a syntax ... of absolute attention to the ordering of sound's syllables. ... Not that this is "lyric" poetry, insofar as that term may assume a musical, or metric, accompaniment to the words: the music rather is built into the sequence of the words' tones, totally saturating the text's sound. ...

    (p. 76)

Take, for example, Charles Bernstein's recent poem "Dysraphism," which appeared in Sulfur, 8 (1983). Here is the poet's note on his title:

    "Dysraphism" is actually a word in use by specialists in congenital diseases, to mean dysfunctional fusion of embryonic parts--a birth defect. ... "Raph" of course means "seam," so for me disraphism is mis-seaming--a prosodic device! But it has the punch of being the same root of rhapsody (rhaph)--or in Skeats--"one who strings (lit. stitches) songs together, a reciter of epic poetry," cf. "ode" etc. In any case, to be simple, Dorland's [the standard U.S. medical dictionary] does define "dysrhafia" (if not dysraphism) as "incomplete closure of the primary neural tube; status dysraphicus"; this is just below "dysprosody" (sic): "disturbance of stress, pitch, and rhythm of speech."9

Bernstein's sensitivity to etymologies and latent meanings is reflected in the poem itself, which is an elaborate "dysfunctional fusion of embryonic parts," a "disturbance of stress, pitch, and rhythm of speech" in the interest of a new kind of urban "rhapsody." The "mis-seaming" of the poem brings together the life of the entire city--let us say New York--with its overheard conversations, advertising slogans, Wall Street jargon, medical terminology, TV clichés, how-to manuals, remembered proverbs, wise sayings, and nonsense rhymes. Like Joyce's "Aeolus" chapter in Ulysses, it playfully exploits such rhetorical figures as pun, anaphora, epiphora, metathesis, epigram, anagram, and neologism to create a seamless web of reconstituted words:

        The pillar's tale: a windowbox onto society.

        But heed not the pear that blows in your

        brain. God's poison is the concept of

        conceptlessness--anaerobic breath.

        No less is culled no more vacated--temptation's

        flight is always to

        beacon's hill--the soul's

        mineshaft.

        Endless strummer. There is never annul-

        ment, only abridgment. The Northern Lights is

        the universe's paneled basement. Joy

        when jogged. Delight in

        forefright.

    (p. 41)

This is not nonsense talk, the collaging of whatever bits and pieces happen to enter the poet's consciousness. Rather, "Dysraphism" violates standard language so as to foreground the discourses actually operative on contemporary writing: the "literary" ("pillar's tale" for Chaucer's "Miller's Tale"), the "sociological" ("a window[box] onto society"), the recourse to proverbial wisdom ("But heed not the pear..."), the obsession with film titles (Endless S[tr]ummer), book titles and publishers' blurbs ("Joy when jogged" for "the joy of jogging" or "Delight in / forefright" rather than "foreplay"). Instructions to the waiter or waitress new on the job ("Fill / the water glasses--ask each person / if they would like / more coffee, etc.") alternate with parodies of medical textbooks ("vaccination of cobalt emissaries pregnant with bivalent expasperation, protruding with inert material") and the lingo of the business conference ("It's a realistic package, it's a / negotiable package, it's / not a final package").

"Dysraphism" thus presents the reader with a world in which the articulation of an individual language is all but prevented by the official discourses that bombard the consciousness from all sides. "Blinded by avenue and filled with / adjacency," "Arch or arched at," how do we avoid speech as mere repetition? Perhaps, the poem implies, by decomposition and recharge--in this case, particularly the recharge of sound. For the psychological self-projection ("Twenty-five years ago I walked..." "It was that night I knew...") of most contemporary free verse, Bernstein substitutes the overdetermination of sound. Sometimes we hear a quasi-Elizabethan iambic pentameter ("that hits the spring to sing with sanguine bulk"), sometimes the tunes of Tin Pan Alley ("No where to go but pianissimo"), everywhere the chiming of rhyme: "Morose or comatose," "Best of the spoils: gargoyles," "Reality is always greener / when you haven't seen her." "Prose / pose" "Poem, chrome," "A fleet of ferries, forever merry." Words, that is to say, are not dependable when it comes to signification, but the play of their sounds is endlessly pleasurable. "Thread / threads the threads, like / thrush. thrombolytic casette." Or, as we read on the poem's last page:

        That is, in prose you start with the world

        and find the words to match; in poetry you start

        with the words and find the world in them.

    (p. 44)

In a world "Riddled / with riot" (a play on Yeats' "Riddled with light" in "The Cold Heaven"), "there is always something dripping through," if we can find it. Otherwise, "We seem to be retreading the same tire / over and over, with no additional traction."

IV

The unmasking of contemporary discourse in poems like "Dysraphism" is, of course, far from innocent. Both in San Francisco and New York, the Language movement arose as an essentially Marxist critique of contemporary American capitalist society on behalf of young poets who came of age in the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate. ...

For one thing, what the Language poets call late monopoly capitalism is never compared to the economic system of existing Marxist countries--the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and their satellites. "The rise of capitalism," writes Silliman, "sets the preconditions for the rise of the novel, the invention of the optical illusion of realism, the final breakdown of gestural poetic forms" (LB, p. 126). Where does the rise of communism fit into this picture? Is Silliman implying that in contemporary China, "the optical illusion of realism" has given way to a valorization of "gestural poetic forms"? Or is the very opposite not the case in countries that can only tolerate socialist realism? Indeed, the transparency of the signifier, its loss of power to be in its own right, seems to me the very hallmark of discourse in the literary journals of, say, East Germany.

Still, poets like Silliman and Bernstein are on to something important when they lament the "invisibility" of language in our "literary" culture. "The words," says Silliman sadly, "are never our own. Rather, they are our own usages of a determinate coding passed down to us like all other products of civilization" (LB, p. 167). The dominance of a sophisticated technology, whether under capitalism or socialism, means that language is always in danger of becoming commodity. Those of us who have taught courses on poetry are familiar with the student with a very high IQ, say a computer science major, who cannot make anything of a poem like Blake's "London" because he or she cannot conceive of a linguistic or social context in which one might refer to a soldier's "hapless sigh" as "Run[ning] like blood down palace walls." In the discourse of medical text books or legal briefs, such statements simply make no sense. ...

Writing is inevitably repetition, but each repetition reveals something else. As Charles Bernstein puts it in a poem called "Sprocket Damage":

        What happens opens up into what

                                                               happens the next time.10

Or, as Ron Silliman playfully paraphrases Freud so as to avoid the familiar id and ego, "When words are, meaning soon follows. Where words join, writing is" (LB, p. 16). > 

### Poetry 1956: A Step Away From Them by Marj

One of the most acclaimed poetry books of 1956 was Richard Wilbur's The Things of This World, published by Harcourt, Brace. Here is the title poem:


        The eyes open to a cry of pulleys,

        And spirited from sleep, the astounded soul

        Hangs for a moment bodiless and simple.

        As false dawn.

        Outside the open window

        The morning air is all awash with angels.

        Some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,

        Some are in smocks: but truly there they are.

        Now they are rising together in calm swells

        Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear

        With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing;

        Now they are flying in place, conveying

        The terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving

        And staying like white water; and now of a sudden

        They swoon down into so rapt a quiet

        That nobody seems to be there.

        The soul shrinks

        From all that it is about to remember,

        From the punctual rape of every blessed day,

        And cries,

        "Oh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry,

        Nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam

        And clear dances done in the sight of heaven."

        Yet, as the sun acknowledges

        With a warm look the world's hunks and colors,

        The soul descends once more in bitter love

        To accept the waking body, saying now

        In a changed voice as the man yawns and rises,

        "Bring them down from their ruddy gallows;

        Let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves;

        Let lovers go sweet and fresh to be undone,

        And the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating

        Of dark habits,

        keeping their difficult balance." (1)

This much anthologized poem (2) provides us with an interesting index to Establishment poetics in the mid-fifties. Its thirty lines are divided into six five-line stanzas, the meter being predominantly iambic pentameter ("Sóme are in smócks: but trúly thére they áre"), with some elegant variation, as when a line is divided into steps (see lines 4, 15, 18, 30), presumably to create a more natural look. A similar effect is gained by the absence of end rhyme, although there is a good deal of alliteration and assonance (e.g., "And spirited from sleep, the astounded soul").

"You must imagine," Wilbur remarked in an interview, "the poem as occurring at perhaps seven-thirty in the morning; the scene is a bedroom high up in a city apartment building; outside the bedroom window, the first laundry of the day is being yanked across the sky and one has been awakened by the squeaking pulleys of the laundry-line." (3) What interests me here is the pronoun "one." Indeed, in the opening stanza, the references are to "The eyes," not "My eyes," to "the astounded soul," not to "my" astounded soul. The claims the poem will evidently make are for the universality of the experience described. Or so it struck three poet-critics--Richard Eberhart, Robert Horan, and May Swenson-- who responded to Wilbur's poem in Anthony Ostroff's anthology The Contemporary Poet as Artist and Critic. (4)

"The important thing about Wilbur's poem," writes Eberhart, "is that it celebrates the immanence of spirit in spite of the 'punctual rape of every blessed day.' The conflict is between a soul-state and an earth-state. The soul wins. The soul, felt as a vision of angelic laundry on awakening, must still be incorporated into the necessities and imperfections of everyday reality. Man is redeemed by the angelic vision" (AO 4). In the last two stanzas, as Robert Horan adds, "the soul (like the laundry emptied of too seraphic a breath), descends to accept the waking body, even though it be in bitter love" (AO 7) Indeed, the poem moves toward the "acceptance of the fact that the sweating, ruined, half-penitent world must be clothed with our compassion. The angel must become human, as heaven must become the street where we walk" (AO 8).

The ideal, for Horan and his fellow poet-critics, is the "difficult balance" of the poem's last line, the balance between body and soul, the material and the spiritual, the disembodied angels and the "heaviest nuns walk[ing] in a pure floating / of dark habits." "The modern lyric," declares May Swenson in her commentary, "is autonomous, a separate mobile . . . an enclosed construct . . . a package individually wrapped" (AO 12). Such an individual package depends upon the careful control of tensions and balances. Notice, for example, the tension between words of stress ("pulleys," "hangs," "shrinks," "gallows") and those of rest ("calm swells," "impersonal breathing," yawns)," between white ("angels," "water," "steam," "linen," "pure") and red ("rape," "rosy," "warm look," "love," "ruddy"). "The whole poem," writes Swenson, "is in fact an epitome of relative weight and equipoise" (AO 16).

The Age Demanded such equipoise, an equipoise, epitomized in 1956, in the poetry world of the Kenyon Review, Partisan Review, Sewanee Review, and so on, by metaphysical poetry, especially that of John Donne, and, more immediately for Wilbur, by the Yeats of "Sailing to Byzantium," who referred to the soul as "clap[ping] its hands" and singing. Responding gratefully to his three readers, Wilbur adds that there are also important allusions in his poem: the title, for example, comes from St. Augustine. And he adds: "Plato, St. Theresa, and the rest of us in our degree having known that it is painful to return to the cave, to the earth, to the quotidian; Augustine says it is love that brings us back. That is why the love of line 23 has got to be bitter--for the sake of psychological truth" (AO 18). As for Robert Horan's mild disclaimer that the poem is somewhat "fastidious" and "remote," Wilbur counters, "I've always agreed with Eliot's assertion that poetry 'is not the expression of personality but an escape from personality'" (AO 19). Hence, evidently, all those references to "one" and to "the astounded soul."

Depersonalization, ambiguity, tension, paradox. We need not dwell here on the merits (or lack thereof) of these New Critical values, for they are only too well known. Rather, what interests me about the laundry-as-angel metaphor, which is the heart of Wilbur's poem, is its curious inaccuracy. "The incident," writes May Swenson, "is so common that everyone has seen it, and . . . the analogy is . . . fitting in each of its details: a shirt is white, it is empty of body, but floats or flies, therefore has life (an angel)" (AO 13). But if, as Wilbur himself explains it, the scene is outside the upper-story window of an apartment building, in front of which "the first laundry of the day is being yanked across the sky," the reality is that the sheets and shirts would probably be covered with specks of dust, grit, maybe even with a trace or two of bird droppings. At best, those sheets seen (if seen at all) from Manhattan highrise windows in the fifties, billowing over the fire-escapes under the newly installed TV aerials, would surely be a bit on the grungy side.

But of course the awakening poet might not notice this because the laundry that, as Wilbur puts it, "is being yanked across the sky," as if by some blind external force, is certainly not his concern; the poet, after all, is represented as having been asleep when it was hung out to dry. Richard Eberhart seems to be aware of this aloofness when he remarks that Wilbur's "is a man's poem. Certainly not all women would like a laundry poem which pays no heed to hard work and coarsened hands. They might say, poet, have your ruddy dream, but give us better detergents" (AO 5). A remarkable fifties statement, this, in its assumption that woman is she who has "coarsened hands" from doing the laundry, while man, that ruddy dreamer, can view that same laundry as angelic. Or, to turn the dichotomy around, woman is she who only dreams of better detergents--a dream, by the way, the affluent fifties were in the process of satisfying-- whereas man dreams idealistically (and hence hopelessly) of "clear dances done in the sight of heaven," dances that might allow him to escape, at least momentarily, "the punctual rape of every blessed day."

"Punctual rape": it is the alarm clock going off, violating one's delightful daydreams, even as Donne's "busie old foole, unruly Sunne" intrudes, through windows and curtains, on the sleeping lovers in "The Sunne Rising." But in Wilbur's poem the intruding daylight is not chided, evidently because to be alive, however difficult, is to be blessed. The metaphor will not withstand much scrutiny, for here, as in the case of the laundry metaphor, the drive is to get beyond the image as quickly as possible, so as to talk about the relation of soul to body, spirit to matter--those great poetic topoi introduced by the Augustine-derived title, "Love Calls us to the Things of This World." The actual "things of this world," in 1956, it turns out, are studiously avoided. The poem refers to "rosy hands in the rising steam"--no doubt, as Eberhart remarks, an allusion to Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" (AO 4), but where are the real hands of those laundresses, hands that Eliot, half a century earlier, had seen "lifting dingy shades in a thousand furnished rooms?"

Let us look at another image of the "things of this world," circa 1956, this one not from a poem but from Robert Frank's book of photographs called The Americans, published by Grove Press in 1959, with a preface by Jack Kerouac. The Americans was the fruit of a cross-country trip, funded by a Guggenheim fellowship; its eighty-two images, culled from more than twenty thousand frames (5), range from Butte, Montana to Beaufort, South Carolina, from New Orleans to New York. Here is Frank's first picture, captioned Parade--Hoboken, New Jersey [Figure 1].

Like Wilbur's "Love Calls Us," this photograph positions the viewer/ reader at a window. But here the focus is not on what is seen (and metaphorized) outside the window but on those who are looking out and on the frame from within which they look (or don't look). Presumably these residents of Hoboken are watching a parade passing by below-- perhaps, as the presence of the flag suggests, a Veterans Day or Memorial Day parade. But who are these viewers? On the left is an elderly woman with blankly staring eyes; she wears what looks like a flowered house dress, and on her left, all but hidden by a curtain, we see an elbow encased in a sleeve made of the same fabric. Two women, then, in some sort of uniform, perhaps the insignia of inmates of an institution But the woman in the right-hand window, whose face is covered by the flag, is dressed differently; she wears a loose jacket or coat, and her upper hand looks like a prosthesis. Is the building a prison? A hospital? An old age home? Or just an apartment house? The picture is at once wholly literal and yet enigmatic: indeed, Frank may not know himself what it is he is shooting.

Interestingly, his photograph exhibits a symmetry that might be compared to the "difficult balance" of Wilbur's last line. The rectangular windows to the left and right meet the edges of the frame, the right one being cropped. The composition is divided into three almost equal parts, window, brick wall, window. Further, the horizontal rectangles--bricks, window sills, partially lowered shade in left window, and large billowing flag (which continues the lower border of the window shade)--create a deceptive grid structure--deceptive because although the windows balance one another, the figures within them do not. The accent, in any case, is on separation--of one body part from another, inside from outside, the flag from the patriotic event it supposely signifies, the viewers from the viewed. The framing, moreover, heightens the sense of confinement suggested by the uniforms--if indeed that is what the matching dresses are.

"Grainy and contrasty," writes John Brumfield, "the photograph is a bit on the harsh side, almost scuzzy, with a sour kind of bleakness emphasized by the immobility of the figures and the monotony of the building." (6) No playful "angelic vision" to redeem man here, no body waking and rising to the world in all its "hunks and colors," no acceptance of the "punctual rape of every blessed day." Which is not to say that Frank's photograph is primarily a protest image. We see women in the windows of a plain brick building bearing a ceremonial flag in honor of the parade referred to in the caption. Period. On the other hand, within the context of The Americans, Parade--Hoboken, New Jersey becomes a link in a chain, a larger image of an America in which the flag, brick wall, dark window, and people aimlessly looking, become part of a larger composition that includes countless juke boxes, lunch counters, motorcyclists, and large sedans at drive-in movie theatres. In Frank's images, people, whether alone, in twos and threes, or in crowds, always seeming curiously detached from one another. His people are nothing so glamorous as thieves to be reformed or lovers to be undone, and besides, the focus is not on their individuality but on their relationships to one another as well as to their culture.

When The Americans was first published, reaction was largely hostile, for its images did not conform to the ameliorist vision of the postwar to be found in the pages of Life and Look, or, for that matter, in The Family of Man exhibition, which opened at the Museum of Modern Art in late 1955 and then travelled around the world with the subtitle "The greatest photographic exhibition of all time." Carl Sandburg, who provided the Prologue, exclaims:

    Everywhere is love and love-making, weddings and babies from generation to generation keeping the Family of Man aliving and continuing. Everywhere the sun, moon and stars, the climates and weathers, have meanings for people. Though meanings vary, we are alike in all countries and tribes in trying to read what sky, land and sea say to us. Alike and ever alike we are on all continents in the need of love, food, clothing, work, speech, worship, sleep, games, dancing, fun. From tropics to arctics humanity lives with these needs so alike, so inexorably alike. (7)

So a photograph of lovers in Italy is juxtaposed to a "comparable" one from New Guinea (see figures 2 and 3), nude pregnant women roaming the rocky steppes of Kordofan (figure 4) are juxtaposed to a blonde pregnant American woman, cosily nestled under a blanket contemplating the pussy cat at her feet (figure 5), and so on. Everywhere, it seems, love calls us to the things of this world.

"Poems," Richard Wilbur remarked in an interview, "are not addressed to anybody in particular." The poem . . . is a conflict with disorder, not a message from one person to another." (8)The poem as "message from one person to another": Frank O'Hara, we shall see, adopted precisely this Wilburian negative, or rather, he had already adopted it before Wilbur made this pronouncement. I shall come back to this point but, for the moment, let's backtrack and try to understand this "conflict with disorder," this containment of chaos, or, as Reuben Brower called it in The Fields of Light, "the aura around a bright clear centre." (9) Robert Frank, an emigre from Switzerland (the one neutral country during the war), who came to the U.S. in 1947 at the age of twenty-three, to experience, at first hand, the fabled American freedom, (10) had nothing at all to say about bright clear centers. But the dominant discourse of the period, whether in photography or poetry, was both centered and centrist, even when, as in the case of Robert Lowell, it was much darker than Richard Wilbur's genial one. The "skunk hour" of Lowell's famous poem, for example, is defined by its allusive relationship to St. John of the Cross's Dark Night of the Soul, and centered by the sign of the "chalk-dry and spar spire / of the Trinitarian Church" that dominates Lowell's Maine village--the emblem, for the poet, of a residual and dessicated Puritanism that could only poison human lives.

In "Memories of West Street and Lepke," which appears just a few pages before "Skunk Hour" in Life Studies (1959), Lowell refers to the decade as the "tranquillized fifties." The reference is specifically to Miltown, the first of the popular tranquillizers ("Tamed by Miltown, we lie on mother's bed" is the opening line of "Man and Wife"), but of course it points more generally at the supposed political apathy and complacency of the affluent fifties. Yet the adjective "tranquillized" gives us little sense of the actual faultlines of the period -- faultlines visible when we read Robert Frank's The Americans against The Family of Man and, as we shall see below, when we read the more radical poets of the fifties against a poet like Wilbur. First, though, I want to sketch in the tensions in question.

Culture Shocks

The lead story of the January 23, 1956 issue of Newsweek was called "The Eisenhower Era." Although the President had not yet made up his mind to run again (that didn't happen until March), and although the public worried that Ike's failing health would put Nixon, who was generally disliked and mistrusted, (11) just "a heartbeat away from the presidency," Eisenhower was enormously popular. Polls gave his performance a 75% approval rating, and no wonder: as Newsweek records, jobs were up from 61.3 to 65 million, taxes were cut although inflation was down, and 57% of Americans owned their own homes as compared to 55% in 1952. The country was at peace--ten years after the end of World War II, three years after the end of the Korean War, and a decade before there was full-fledged war in Vietnam, Americans were not fighting anywhere on the globe. And even McCarthyism was losing its force: the Senator, curtailed by the Senate's condemnation motion of December 1954, was to die within the year.

In his Introduction to Colliers's new series on "The American Tradition," Henry Steele Commager asked, "What has America meant to mankind?" and he replied:

It has meant a chance to prove that men could govern themselves, and to show that a vast continent with the greatest diversity of interest and mixture of peoples could nevertheless hold together as a single nation. It has meant an example to the whole world of expansion without imperialism and power without militarism. And it has meant freedom--freedom from tyrannical government, freedom from economic oppression, freedom from ignorance and superstition.

These are all part of the American tradition, and so, too, those less dramatic and quieter things--the land itself, so spacious and various and beautiful, the struggle with the frontier carried on from generation to generation; the spread of plenty and well- being over a large area; the widest experiment in public education in all history, schoolhouses in every village and town, and colleges and universities in every state of the land; the elevation of the status and dignity of woman; philanthropy on a scale never before practiced; the spread of libraries and museums and orchestras and the quickening of pride in the commonwealth. All this, too, is part of the American tradition. (27 April 1956, p. 21)

From the hindsight of 1996, we tend to read these optimistic and patriotic declarations of '56 with great skepticism. But it's important to remember that there was a grain of truth in Commager's article: the creation of new universities, orchestras, libraries, and cultural centers was astonishing as was the affluence that made it possible for, say, the young Allen Ginsberg, arriving in San Francisco in 1954 with only $20 in his pocket, to land "almost immediately" a market research position with Towne-Oller Associates, an elegant firm on Montgomery Street. He had a secretary and was making up to $450 a month. (12) And when, a few months later, Ginsberg told his psychiatrist that what he really wanted to do was to stop work, write poetry, spend days out of doors, visit museums and friends, and cultivate his own perceptions and visions, Dr. Hicks replied, "Well, why don't you?" A challenge that Ginsberg quickly accepted, managing (on what?) to produce the poems to be collected in Howl (1956). (13) On the other coast, meanwhile, Frank O'Hara, living with a succession of friends and lovers in a succession of wonderfully cheap apartments (c. $60 a month), was able to find work at the ticket booth or card shop of the Museum of Modern Art so as to support his poetic habit. But then of course O'Hara and Ginsberg were hardly members of the working class. They were Ivy Leaguers (Harvard and Columbia respectively), and in the mid-fifties Ivy Leaguers could always get by somehow.

Indeed, the affluence of the Eisenhower years was nowhere more visible than in the booming university culture (thanks to the GI Bill) and arts establishment. It was a time of ardent Francophilia: on Broadway, Julie Harris was starring in The Lark, Jean Anouilh's sentimental psychodrama about Joan of Arc, and Giraudoux's version of the Trojan War, La Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu was a big hit in Christopher Fry's verse translation, Tiger at the Gates. The Comedie Française on tour presented Molière's Bourgeois Gentilhomme and Marivaux's Arlequin poli par l'amour. Simon and Schuster brought out an English translation of Proust's Jean Santeuil (reviewed in The Nation by Mina Curtis), Vintage published Montaigne's autobiography, Baudelaire's art criticism (under the title The Mirror of Art), Bergson's Comedy, Gide's Strait is the Gate and his Journals, and Camus's The Rebel. And Harcourt Brace published a new translation of Molière's Le Misanthrope by none other than Richard Wilbur.

It was still a time, then, when mainstream publishers brought out "serious" literary works, preferably French or at least foreign (but rarely, in this early postwar period, German). And not only literary: Doubleday, today a largely commercial house, published a new translation of Diderot's Rameu's Nephew, Ortega y Gasset's Dehumanization of Art, Henri Frankfort's Birth of Civilization in the Near East, Arthur Waley's Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China, and, what was to be a central work for both John Cage and Jackson Mac Low, Suzuki's Zen Buddhism, Selected Writing.

The reader will have noticed by now that, so far as foreign high culture is concerned, Writer almost invariably equaled Male, Simone de Beauvoir's Mandarins, being a major exception. At the same time--and this is an interesting spin on the culture industry--the U.S. novel (as well as a fair amount of the poetry, from Leonie Adams, Elizabeth Bishop, and Louise Bogan, to Babette Deutsch, Carolyn Kizer, Elizabeth Spencer, and Ruth Stone) was largely the domain of women. Katharine Anne Porter's Ship of Fools, serialized in the Atlantic in 1956, was one of the major literary events of a year that also boasted the publication of Mary McCarthy's A Charmed Life and Caroline Gordon's The Malfactors. An important story by Flannery O'Connor, "Greenleaf," appeared in the summer issue of the Kenyon Review. And, although I haven't done a count, reviewers in the mainstream journals and little magazines were more likely to be women in 1956 than in 1996: Bishop, Miles, and Kizer reviewed frequently for The New Republic, McCarthy, Vivienne Koch, Mary O. Hivnor, and Margaret Avison for the Kenyon Review, Dorothy Van Ghent and Marie Boroff for the Yale Review, and so on. Given the large number of women among fiction readers, women were allowed--indeed encouraged-- to write fiction, but they were almost never editors or publishers, and, with such exceptions as Hannah Arendt and Suzanne Langer, not eligible to be major "thinkers."

No wonder, then, that when a Pittsburgh TV station (WQED), aided by special funds from the Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, inaugurated a series of monthly programs on intellectuals, it was called "Wise Men." The first Wise Man of the Month was Robert Frost. "Tapping the top of a high-toe shoe," we read in Colliers (27 April), "he says poems simple in sound, profound in thought, and amazes his audience with the range of his knowledge" (p. 42). In Pittsburgh, Frost faced an audience of thousands and he was interviewed by another "Wise Man," Jonah Salk.

In response to Salk's question about poetic form, Frost made his famous declaration, "I'd as soon write free verse as play tennis with the net down," a pronouncement few established poets at the time seemed eager to quarrel with. As Wilbur put it, "I have no case whatever against controlled free verse. Yet I think it is absurd to feel that free verse--which has only been with us in America for a little over a hundred years--has definitely 'replaced' measure and rhyme and other traditional instruments." (14) As for the larger function of poetry, Frost declared that "My poems are my adjustment to the world," a revealing statement, for adjustment was one of the big watchwords of the psychoanalytic fifties, the drive to be "well-adjusted" dominating so much of the personal life of the period. In Freudian parlance, moreover, "well-adjusted" was a code-word for "straight": the "well-adjusted" got married, had families, and lived what were then called "normal" lives.

A paradox of this high-culture moment, when funds were as readily available for "Wise Men" series as for symphonies and museum exhibitions, is that, so far as the Literary Establishment was concerned, the practices of the early-century avant-garde--of Futurism, Italian and French, as of Dada and Surrealism and Russian Constructivism--might just as well have never existed. (15) The free verse / metrical verse quarrel, for example, doesn't even begin to take account of such voco-visual poetic experiments as Kurt Schwitters's Ursonate. In the Kenyon and Sewanee, the poet of choice (as Wilbur's "Love Calls Us" confirms) was John Donne (see, for example, the symposium on "English Verse and What It Sounds Like" in the Fall 1956 issue of Kenyon Review, where Seymour Chatman and Arnold Stein and John Crowe Ransom discuss Donne's prosody), the "great" modern poets, Yeats, Frost, and the Eliot of Four Quartets and the verse dramas.

Perhaps "playing tennis with the net down" seemed so dangerous because the cultural order, impressively artistic and intellectual as it was at one level, could not easily deal with the tensions just beneath the surface. In the mid-fifties, the U.S. was the richest and most powerful country in the world but also, as one critic puts it, the "most jittery." (16) And for good reason. In 1956 not an issue of Look or Colliers or Newsweek went by without some reference to the Cold War. Articles bear names like "Must our Air Force be Second Best?" (Look, May 1), "Ex-Stalinists of the West," (a discussion of the response of the various European Communist parties to Khrushchev's speech denouncing Stalin, which took place in April of '56; see New Republic, April 9), "The Red Atom" (Colliers, November 23), "Algeria--can France hold on?" (New Republic, April 9), "Communism in South East Asia" (Yale Review, Spring 1956), and so on. One of the most startling articles, from the perspective of later developments, is Peter Kalischer's "Upsetting the Red Timetable," in the July 6 issue of Colliers (p. 29). "Two years ago at Geneva," writes Kalischer, "South Vietnam was virtually sold down the river to the Communists. Today the spunky little Asian country is back on its own feet, thanks to a 'mandarin in a sharkskin suit,'" who was none other than President Ngo Dinh Diem. "Today," we read, "a republic nine months old, South Vietnam is alive, kicking, and pugnaciously anti-Communist." Or so it was hoped, given that, as early as 1956, according to Kalischer, 53% of all U.S. foreign aid was going to buttress the South Vietnamese armed forces.

But the obsession with the Soviet Union's possible and projected acts of aggression, excessive as it may strike us now that the Cold War is over, was by no means a figment of the Pentagon's imagination. For by the autumn of 1956, just two weeks before Eisenhower was re-elected in a landslide, an event took place that marked a significant turning point in Cold War politics. That event was the aborted Hungarian Revolution. Fighting broke out on October 23 and by the 28th, the Imre Nagy government proclaimed a cease-fire, demanded withdrawal of Soviet forces from its capital, reconstituted the pre-1947 democratic parties of workers and peasants, and announced the abandonment of a one-party regime, withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, neutrality, and free elections. The Soviets hesitated but when the West made no move, on November 4, they moved in tanks, brutally crushing the rebellion. Almost 200,000 refugees came to the U.S. within the next few months.

The press devoted a good deal of space to the failed revolution as to the Poznan workers' riots that took place almost simultaneously in Poland. Together with the Suez crisis of July (which signalled the end of British imperialism in the Middle East) and the Egypt-Israeli war that broke out in October, the year that began with such euphoric commentary on American affluence and world peace was ending in a kind of nightmare. No longer could the U.S. trust in Kruschchev's "revisionist" intentions. Even The Nation, which in the earlier months of 1956 had reported enthusiastically about the new Five-Year Plan for consumer goods (Alexander Werth, "Russia's Hopes for 1960: Steel, Power and Food," February 18), and about the Soviets's good intentions so far as disarmament was concerned (Paul Wohl and Alexander Werth, "New Soviet Blueprint: Challenge to the West," March 3), was forced to admit that the Russians were not to be trusted. "10 Days that Shook the World: The Counter-Revolution," was the title of Mark Gayn's November 10 piece about events in Eastern Europe.

And further: the difficulties abroad were matched at home by the aftershocks of the Desegregation of the Schools Act of 1954. Indeed, although one would never know it, in reading, say, The Kenyon Review or even the Black Mountain Review (Black Mountain College, incidentally, closed in 1956), the race wars were an especially poisonous feature of the discourse of these years. Even Adlai Stevenson, the darling of the liberals, was not exempt. The Montgomery bus boycott, which began in December 1955, came to a head in January '56 and brought Martin Luther King to national attention. But, as Carey McWilliams points out in an article called "Mr. Stevenson on Jim Crow" (Nation, February 18), Stevenson paid little attention to the problem.

In the September 24 issue of The New Republic, L. D. Reddick, then a student at Fisk University, reviewed Robert Penn Warren's little book, Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South. Warren, who was teaching at Vanderbilt, was extremely cautious about integration. It shouldn't, he observed, come too soon, for the Negro was not ready for it. Such caution was the theme of a Look special feature (3 April), evaluating the Desegregation Act. The issue begins by reprinting the famous Supreme Court Decision, as expounded by Chief Justice Earl Warren: "'We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place." But this view is countered in Senator Sam Ervin Jr.'s "The Case for Segregation," with its current wisdom that "people like to socialize with their own" (p. 32). And in an ostensibly neutral article called "Fear underlies the Conflict," William Atwood writes:

Whatever they may tell you, white Southerners are afraid of the Negro in their midst. And they are afraid of him today as never before. For the Negro no longer behaves like the amiable 'dark' who knew his place and did not question the white man's right to give orders.

The fear is partly political. In the Black Belt, white men shudder at the prospect of Negro bloc-voting that might put them under the jurisdiction of colored officials. Still haunted by the nightmare of Reconstruction, they now feel that any concession to Negro demands for equality means another surrender, another Appomattox.

The fear is also economic. Industrialization has enabled Negroes to earn wages that are making them independent of an economic order based on discrimination. . . . A negro with money in the bank is no longer at the mercy of the dominant race; he becomes a customer to be catered to.

And the fear is social, with profound sexual undertones. To a white Southerner, classroom integration implies a kind of social equality that does not exist even on an assembly line. He will tell you that sooner or later, some Negro boy will be walking his daughter home from school, staying for supper, taking her to the movies . . . and then your Southern friend asks you the inevitable, the clinching question, "Would you want your daughter to marry a Nigra?"

And there is nothing you can say to quiet his fears . . . that mixed schools will "mongrelize" the race. (p. 27).

Atwood doesn't say he subscribes to this point of view but neither does he condemn it. And again, it may have taken an outsider like Robert Frank to show us what everyday life in the South looked like in 1956. (figures 6 [Funeral--St. Helena, South Carolina], 7 [Charleston, South Carolina], 8 [Trolley, New Orleans]). In the latter photograph, for example, seven people -- up front, a formally dressed white man and, behind him, white woman, in the rear, a shirtsleeved black man and casually attired black woman, and in the center, two white children, dressed up in what look like party clothes, with their all but invisible black nanny hovering behind them-- are placed within a tight grid: windows separated by metal strips, upper rectangular panels, reflecting only dimly what is going by outside the streetcar, and the metal surface below the window, again broken up into rectangles, separated by a studded strip. The grid indicates not only race but gender separation and hierarchy: in all three cases, the man (or little boy) comes first.

None of the passengers look at one another; rather, all are looking out at something--but what? The white man's face is veiled by the reflection of the glass because his window is down, the white woman's head is cropped as is the black woman's elbow. But whereas the whites sit facing front in "normal" position, the children and tbe black man and women are turned 90%, facing out of the window, the black woman in back looking over her left shoulder. The photograph makes no overt comment on segregation, the faces of the blacks at the rear of the car, for instance, show no anger. But the image of the jail-like grid is there, startling testimony that the Family of Man, the entity that Sandburg called "one big family hugging close to the ball of Earth for its life and being," is more accurately an aggregate of wholly separate beings placed together in a series of arbitrarily defined spaces that have been assigned to them. "Robert," said Allen Ginsberg in a 1985 piece on Frank's work, "had invented a new way of lonely solitary chance conscious seeing, in the little Leica format. . . . Spontaneous glance--accident truth." (17)

Counterpoetics

"Lonely solitary chance conscious seeing": Ginsberg might have been talking about his own poetry or, for that matter, of the "New American Poetry" as it manifested itself in 1956, the year of Howl, as well as of some of Frank O'Hara's most important "lunch poems," (18) and of John Ashbery's Some Trees, which won the Yale Younger Poets Prize for 1956. The usual view is that Ginsberg was a "public" poet, O'Hara and Ashbery much more private and "apolitical" ones, but it would be more accurate to say that in the work of all three (and this is also true for their intersecting but different circles), the political is internalized in very curious and complicated ways. Complicated in that, unlike their avant-garde precursors of the early century (Mayakovsky, an important model both for Ginsberg and for O'Hara, is a case in point), fifties poets, however radical or counterculture they took themselves to be, seem to have had no meaningful access to a public sphere that operated according to increasingly incomprehensible laws.

A terrifying and ideologically charged war had just been "won," but before the lessons of that war and the Holocaust could in any way be assimilated, much less digested, our former allies, the Soviets, were shown to have committed genocide that rivalled Hitler's--genocide, moreover, against their own people, beginning with the destruction of the peasantry in the course of the collectivization of the farms and culminating in the Gulag. The cycle of totalitarianism and death seemed to be starting all over again, this time with the new threat of nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Cold War was just that--cold--which is to say a very distant reality to those who actually lived their everyday life in the New York or San Francisco of the later fifties. If you were a male white poet, even a gay male white poet in 1956, the reality of everyday life was the reality of possibility. New ballets to see and great Italian movies to go to, new gay bars in the Village or in North Beach, new art galleries showing breakthrough painting and performances of John Cage's "Music of Changes." At the same time, for Ginsberg, as for O'Hara and Ashbery, possibility was consistently threatened by the awareness that there were jobs they, as gay men, could not hold, places they were not wanted, and that the bars they frequented were regularly raided.

Diagnosis and critique, thirties-style, were out of the question, there being no specific "them" to blame for international conditions and no commitment, as yet, to focus on the plight of minorities at home. Better not to think about politics at all and to concentrate, as fifties poetry did with a vengeance, on personal fulfillment. Even Ginsberg's "angelheaded hipsters," after all, were those who, in the words of "Howl," "drag[ged] themselves through the negro streets" (notably not their streets but the streets of Harlem) "looking for an angry fix," or "drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity." (19) En route to vision, there was a good deal of contradiction, as in Ginsberg's marvelously comic, marvellously painful ode of 1956 called "America." It begins:

    America I've given you all and now I'm nothing.

    America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.

    I can't stand my own mind.

    America when will we end the human war?

    Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.

    I don't feel good don't bother me. (20)

Warren Tallmann rightly called "America" "the nearest thing to a purely clown poem Ginsberg has." (21) It's not that the poet isn't genuinely worried about the atomic bomb and the Cold War, but the relationship between public and private has become so fractured that the strongest urge is to opt out. "I don't feel good don't bother me" is a candid admission that he, at any rate, doesn't want to participate--not in war (Ginsberg was not drafted because of his near-sightedness), but not in oppositional activity either. The only way to respond, it seems, is to play the fool:

When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?

America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.

Your machinery is too much for me.

You made me want to be a saint.

There must be some other way to settle this argument. (AGCP 146)

But what is rarely remarked is that the droll self-deprecation we find in "America" is itself a function of affluence. Consider the following lines:

I smoke marijuana every chance I get.

I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet. . . .

My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right.

I won't say the Lord's Prayer

I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations

America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia.

I'm addressing you.

Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?

I'm obsessed by Time Magazine.

I read it every week.

Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.

I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.

It's always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious.

Movie producers are serious. Everybody's serious but me.

It occurs to me that I am America,

I am talking to myself again.

Asia is rising against me.

I haven't got a chinaman's chance.

I'd better consider my national resources.

My national resources consist of two joints ot marijuana millions of genitals

an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour

and twenty-five-thousand mental institutions.

I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live

in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.

I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go.

My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I'm a Catholic. (146-47)

The latter part of this passage acts as an index to the U.S. "concerns" of the day, as reported in the newspapers-- the U.S. obsession with Communist China, the flaunting of "national resources," the burgeoning prison and mental-hospital population (Ginsberg knew the latter at first hand), and the public indifference to the underprivileged "liv[ing] in my flowerpots" (a foreshadowing of the homelessness to come two decades later). And Ginsberg is wonderfully deft at weaving together the clichés of press talk ("Asia is rising against [us]") with ordinary racist cliché ("I haven't got a chinaman's chance"), memories of personal oppression, as in the reference to Uncle Max, jokes about middle-class morality ("I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go"--this latter, a reference to William Burroughs, who went there for the sake of the drug culture), and finally with the common wisdom of the day (pace then Senator John F. Kennedy) that a Catholic could not be elected president in the Protestant U.S.
But it is also the case that Ginsberg's absurdist "holy litany" is predicated on the availability of possessions undreamt of by the citizens of other nations in 1956-- plenty of free time, liquor, marijuana, the public library, and money to pay the psychoanalyst-- so that the "national resources" he lampoons so brilliantly are also ones he takes for granted. Again, the catalogue "America free Tom Mooney / America save the Spanish Loyalists / America Sacco & Vanzetti must not die / America I am the Scottboro boys" and the spoof on anti-Communist paranoia in Ginsberg's "cigar-store Cherokee" (22) parody dialect--"The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia's power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. . . . Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations" (H 33)-- is undercut by the campy conclusion:

America is this correct?

I'd better get right down to the job.

It's true I don't want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I'm nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.

America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.

Here is a twist to "Love Calls Us to the Things of this World" that Richard Wilbur didn't have in mind. Ginsberg's candor and colloquialism, his pointed imagery (so different from Wilbur's elegant metaphysical conceits), his defiantly anti-poetic, non-scannable chant-like verse, his willingness to let it all hang out, his refusal to play the game, his admission of weakness--these were surely a breath of fresh air in the poetic world of 1956. Indeed, the stunning conclusion, with its allusion to Whitman's equally queer if more decorous apostrophes to America, remains a watershed in postwar American poetry.

Yet--and this is a signature of the time -- no matter how "oppositional" Ginsberg's stance purports to be, its disengagement (drop out, get high, have sex) may leave us feeling slightly queasy. Unlike its models--Whitman's "Song of Myself" and "I Hear America Singing," Blaise Cendrars's "Easter in New York," "Apollinaire's "Zone," Mayakovsky's "Cloud in Trousers"--poems where personal vision goes hand in hand with serious social critique --here putting one's "queer shoulder to the wheel" is not likely to lead to anything. "I'm in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet." Is it a wise passiveness? Or just, in the words of Ginsberg's first book title, an "empty mirror"?

A somewhat different spin occurs in a related poem of 1956,

Frank O'Hara's "A Step Away from Them.":

    It's my lunch hour, so I go

    for a walk among the hum-colored

    cabs. First down the sidewalk

    where laborers feed their dirty

    glistening torsos sandwiches

    and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets

    on. They protect them from falling

    bricks, I guess. Then onto the

    avenue where skirts are flipping

    above heels and blow up over

    grates. The sun is hot, but the

    cabs stir up the air. I look

    at bargains in wristwatches. There

    are cats playing in the sawdust.

    On

    to Times Square, where the sign

    blows smoke over my head, and higher

    the waterfall pours lightly. A

    Negro stands in a doorway with a

    toothpick, languorously agitating.

    A blonde chorus girl clicks: he

    smiles and rubs his chin. Everything

    suddenly honks : it is 12:40 of

    a Thursday.

    Neon in daylight is a

    great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would

    write, as are light bulbs in daylight.

    I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET'S

    CORNER. Giulietta Masina, wife of

    Federico Fellini, è bell' attrice.

    And chocolate malted. A lady in

    foxes on such a day puts her poodle

    in a cab.

    There are several Puerto

    Ricans on the avenue today, which

    makes it beautiful and warm. First

    Bunny died, then John Latouche,

    then Jackson Pollock. But is the

    earth as full as life was full, of them?

    And one has eaten and one walks,

    past the magazines with nudes

    and the posters for BULLFIGHT and

    the Manhattan Storage Warehouse,

    which they'll soon tear down. I

    used to think they had the Armory

    Show there.

    A glass of papaya juice

    and back to work. My heart is in my

    pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy. (23)




In this famous "lunch poem," public events obviously play much less of a role than in Ginsberg's "America." Indeed, its oppositionality would seem to be all on the level of rhetoric. For Wilbur's highly crafted stanzas, O'Hara substitutes a nervous short free-verse line, breaks coming at the least expected junctures and creating a taut suspension, as in the very first lines, "It's my lunch hour, so I go / for a walk among the hum-colored / cabs." (24) Again, for Wilbur's studied impersonality, O'Hara substitutes the intimate address, whether to a friend or to himself, he describes in "Personism," (25) and for Wilbur's elaborately contrived metaphor (as in the case of the "angelic" bed-sheets, "rising together in calm swells / Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear / With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing"), O'Hara's "I" substitutes persons, places, and objects that are palpable, real, and closely observed.

The poet's lunch-hour walk, presumably from the Museum of Modern Art on 53d St. between 5th and 6th Avenue in the direction of Times Square, is full of enticing sights and sounds: cabs hum, laborers in hard hats (whose "dirty / glistening torsos" the gay poet subliminally desires) are eating sandwiches and drinking Coca-Cola, the skirts of girls in high heels (the then proverbial office uniform) "flip" and "blow up over / grates," the myriad cut-rate jewelry shops on 6th Avenue try to outdo each other with "bargains in wristwatches," the huge Chestfield ad above Times Square blows smoke at the cigarette-friendly pedestrian, a black man, hanging out in a doorway makes eyes at a blonde chorus girl walking by, and the Puerto Ricans on the Avenue are enough to make it, by the poet's Dadaesque reasoning, "beautiful and warm." Pleasurable, too, are the absurd contradictions representative of New York life: the "Negro . . . with a toothpick, langurously agitating," the "Neon in daylight" and "lightbulbs in daylight," the lunchspots with fancy names like JULIET'S CORNER that serve cheeseburgers and chocolate malteds, the ladies with poodles who wear fox furs even on the hottest summer day,, and so on.

But, as James E. B. Breslin noted in his excellent essay on O'Hara (JEB 210-49), the poet seems to be "a step away," not only from the dead friends (Bunny Lang, John Latouche, Jackson Pollock) he will memorialize later in the poem, but from all the persons and objects in his field of vision "Sensations," writes Breslin, "disappear almost as soon as they are presented. Objects and people . . . remain alien to a poet who can never fully possess them"(JEB 218). The question is why. For Breslin, the poet's malaise, his inability to hold on to things, to move toward any kind of transcendence beyond the fleeting, evanescent moment is largely a function of O'Hara's unique psychological make-up. But since, as Breslin himself suggests, O'Hara's fabled "openness is an admitted act of contrivance and duplicity" (JEB 231), we might consider the role culture plays in its formation.

Consider, to begin with, the repeated metonymic displacements of specific metaphors. New York's yellow cabs are compared to bees ("hum-colored"), but their color relates them to the laborers' "yellow helmets," worn to "protect them from falling / bricks, I guess." Yellow helmets, yellow jackets: the poem's brilliance is to connect these disparate items and yet to leave the import of the connection hanging. Is the tentative explanation ("I guess") about "falling bricks" tongue-in-cheek or serious? In the same vein, "skirts" are no sooner seen "flipping / above heels" in the hot air than they are described as "blow[ing] up over/ grates," even as the sign high up in Times Square "blows smoke over my head." "Blow," for O'Hara, always has sexual connotations, but "blow up," soon to be the title of Antonioni's great film, also points to the vocabulary of nuclear crisis omnipresent in the public discourse of these years. And now the muted and intermittent sounds of skirts flipping, smoke blowing, cabs stirring up the air, and cats playing in the sawdust give way to the moment when "Everything / suddenly honks: it is 12.40 of / a Thursday." Here sound is illogically related to time: gridlock in the streets, an absolutely ordinary event in midtown Manhattan, somehow makes the poet look up at the big clock above Times Square and have the surreal sense that time iscoming to a stop. The connection is momentary (rather like an air-raid siren going off), but it changes the pedestrian's mood. At 12:40, at any rate, lunch hour has passed the half-way point, and now thoughts of the dead come to the fore--or were they already there in the reference to the "sawdust" in which the cats play? The pronoun "I" shifts to the impersonal "one"; "neon in daylight" is no longer such a pleasure, revealing as it does the "magazines with nudes / and the posters for BULLFIGHT," and the mortuary-like "Manhattan Storage Warehouse / which they'll soon tear down," the reference to the Armory in the next line linking death with war.

By this time, the "great pleasure" of the poet's lunch hour has been occluded by anxiety. Not the fear of anything in particular: O'Hara's New York is still a long way from the crime and drug-ridden Manhattan of the nineties. On the contrary, the poet's anxiety seems to stem from the sheer glut of sensation: so many new and colorful things to see-- new movies starring Giuletta Massina, new Ballachine ballets for Edwin Denby to write about, new editions of Reverdy poems, new buildings going up all over town. Colorful, moreover, is now associated with persons of color: the poet, exoticizing the Other, takes pleasure in the "click" between the "langurously agitating Negro" and "blonde chorus girl" (a sly parody of the scare question being asked with regularity in the wake of the Desegregation Act of 1954, "Would you want your daughter to marry a Nigra?") (26) , and he observes playfully that "There are several Puerto Ricans on the avenue today, which / makes it beautiful and warm." Yet--and here the contrast replicates the juxtapositions found in Look or Colliers-- for every exotic sight and delightful sensation, there are falling bricks, bullfights, blow ups and blow outs, armories, mortuaries, and, as the name Juliet's Corner suggests, tombs. In this context, ironically, the actual death references in the poem ("First / Bunny died . . .") function almost as overkill.

The "glass of papaya juice " of the penultimate lines sums it up nicely. Papaya, now sold in every large city supermarket, was a new commodity in the fifties; the new Puerto Rican emigres (who, for Frank, make it "beautiful and warm") were opening juice bars all over Manhattan. Papaya juice was considered not only exotic but healthful, the idea of drinking fruit and vegetable drinks that are good for you being itself a novelty in this period. The juice bar O'Hara frequents on the way "back to work" makes a wonderful contrast to the hamburger joint where he had lunch. Cheeseburger & malted: this all-American meal, soon to be marketed around the globe by McDonald's, gives way to the glass of papaya juice--a new "foreign" import. But the juice the poet ingests is also contrasted to the heart which is in "my pocket" and which is "Poems by Pierre Reverdy." The heart is not in the body where it belongs but worn externally, in the poet's pocket. And again it is a foreign (in this case, French) vintage.

In the boom economy of the late fifties, such new foreign imports created a daydream world of exotic pleasures. But the yellow helmets (also reminiscent of air raid helmets) and falling bricks, the sudden honking, the large-scale razing of buildings, and the Bullfight poster remind us, as they remind the poet, that the delights proffered by the culture are not only transient, as Breslin suggests, but that there may well be nothing behind the "neon in daylight" surfaces. Which--and this is the poet's as well as the reader's quandary --doesn't make them any less desirable. On the contrary, whereas Wilbur's "Love Calls Us," argues that we must accept the fallen world with love and compassion, "A Step Away from Them" asserts that, yes, of course, our fallen world (fallen from what?) of "dirty glistening torsos" is lovable (whether it "deserves" our love is a question O'Hara would never presume to answer!), but wonders how the hell we can survive those artificial waterfalls and falling bricks. To which the answer, in the words of the neighboring "Song [Is it Dirty?]" is "you don't refuse to breathe do you" (FOH 327).

Thus the personal becomes the political. O'Hara's close friend John Ashbery, who was, in these same years, translating Reverdy, internalized the "march of events" even more fully. His response was to produce fragmented narrative in which the hackneyed discourse of the popular press, patriotic sloganeering, literary and film allusions, and highly private references were woven together in a seemingly seamless whole, the poet shifting roles so rapidly that it was impossible to identify his voice in the poem. When it first appeared in 1956 in an edition of 817 copies, Ashbery's second book, Some Trees (Yale University Press) was a hopeless anomaly, despite its prize-winning status. (27) The poet himself was not available to defend it; he had left the U.S. for Paris in '55, not to return for a decade. In a 1988 interview with O'Hara's biographer Brad Gooch, Ashbery sketches in the background for this decade abroad:

    I couldn't write anything from about the summer of 1950 to the end of 1951. It was a terribly depressing period both in the world and in my life. I had no income or prospects. The Korean War was on and I was afraid I might be drafted. There were anti- homosexual campaigns. I was called up for the draft and I pleaded that as a reason not to be drafted. Of course this was recorded and I was afraid that we'd all be sent to concentration camps if McCarthy had his own way. It was a very dangerous and scary period." (28)

But the reality of 1956 was more complicated than this later rationalization would suggest. The "danger" and "scariness" does enter the poetry, but its mediations are multiple. Here is "Two Scenes," the opening poem of Some Trees:

    I

    We see us as we truly behave:

    From every corner comes a distinctive offering.

    The train comes bearing joy;

    The sparks it strikes illuminate the table.

    Destiny guides the water-pilot, and it is destiny.

    For long we hadn't heard so much news, such noise.

    The day was warm and pleasant.

    "We see you in your hair,

    Air resting around the tips of mountains."

    II

    A fine rain anoints the canal machinery.

    This is perhaps a day of general honesty

    Without example in the world's history

    Though the fumes are not of a singular authority

    And indeed are dry as poverty.

    Terrific units are on an old man

    In the blue shadow of some paint cans

    As laughing cadets say, "In the evening

    Everything has a schedule, if you can find out what it is." (29)

Ironically enough, this particular poem was first published in The Kenyon Review (Spring 1956), where it was wedged between two quite conventional poems, Herbert Morris's "Twenty-Eight" and Theodore Holmes's "The Life of the Estate," the latter containing such passages as "The house sits up on the hill; and has that satisfied look / Of a head taking credit for the comfort the body enjoys in bed." (30) Given its title and its "normal" stanzaic appearance ("Two Scenes" has two nine line stanzas, its lines ranging from six to fifteen syllables), the Kenyon readership might have glanced at it and concluded that it was just another pictorial poem, with pastoral references to "tips of mountains" and "a fine rain." Those who did actually read it, however, must have been more than a little confused.

"We see us," the poem opens, "as we truly behave." Not as the familiar adage has it, "We see ourselves as others see us," and certainly not "We see ourselves as we truly are," but, inconsequentially (for how could it be otherwise, given that the other's behavior is the one thing we certainly can "see"), "as we truly behave." The assertive opening statement is thus no more than tautology, and hence empty gesture, even as the lines that follow convey perfectly reasonable information that doesn't add up because there is no context that relates "a" to "b." "From every corner comes a distinctive offering": a simple enough sentence and suggestive of formal ceremony: the journey of the Magi or homage to the Queen on her birthday, perhaps. "The train comes bearing joy" is equally reasonable, but how do "The sparks it (the train?) strikes illuminate the table"? What table? And in line 4 the expected train conductor or engineer turns out to be a water-pilot; perhaps, then, the table of line 3 was a water table. The ominously repeated reference to "destiny" defies explanation, at least at this point in the poem, but clearly the arrival of the boat (which has now replaced the train) is significant: "For long we hadn't heard so much news, such noise." Line 7 in contrast, is straightforward description: "The day was warm and pleasant" sounds like the opening of any standard short story in a highschool textbook. But again the statement is undercut: the familiar pop song line "I see you in my dreams" becomes the absurd "We see you in your hair," "hair" now rhyming with the "Air" that opens the next line, a line that recalls a Chinese or Japanese brush painting where air seems to rest "around the tips of mountains." This last statement is in quotations, but who says it?

What, then, is the poem all about? In II, which by no means follows I, the first five lines (the first three are rough hexameters) rhyme on unstressed suffixes of abstract nouns: "machinery," "honesty," "history," "authority," "poverty." The verse lumbers on dully, rather like badly written skeltonics. Yet this stanza does refer back to Scene I. The fine rain anointing the canal machinery takes us back to the movements of the water-pilot; perhaps he is steering his ship down the canal. The destiny that guides the pilot is real enough, since "This is perhaps a day of general honesty / Without example in the world's history / Though the fumes are not of a singular authority / And indeed as dry as poverty." A mock-announcement is about to be made but it never occurs. Rather, the poet's camera zeros in on "an old man / In the blue shadow of some paint cans." Picasso (and Stevens's) "man with the blue guitar"? Or just an old housepainter? We can never be sure: "As laughing cadets say, 'In the evening / Everything has a schedule, if you can find out what it is."

The last line with its Wittgensteinian twist might serve as an epigraph for any number of Ashbery poems and, for that matter, for the language poems that are their successors. On the one hand, procedure is all--everything has a schedule, a formula, an instruction manual. On the other, you can never "find out what it is." Its meaning eludes us. But the "if" ensures that we keep on looking. And indeed, "Two Scenes" is not at all non-referential. When we reread it, we note that it foregrounds the basic need to decipher what one sees--to catch that "distinctive offering" coming to us "from every corner." And the ciphers are indeed tantalizing, the train, the sparks that illuminate the table, the water-pilot making his way through the canal in a fine rain, the canal fumes, the blue shadow of the paint cans, the laughing cadets. Is this a journey up river in a Conrad novel? Are we witnessing a love scene ("We see you in your hair")? Or a film account of mobilization, the laughing cadets waving goodbye to those of us who remain behind?

One way to approach these questions it to read the poem as a cultural as well as a lyrical text. The mid-fifties, as we have seen in Henry Steele Commager's paean to America, was a time bloated with patriotic and nationalist slogans. "Destiny guides the water-pilot and it is destiny," surely echoes Roosevelt's ringing "I have a rendezvous with destiny" as well as the Hollywood film God is my Co-Pilot. "This is perhaps a day . . . without example in the world's history" recalls the President's reference to December 7 (Pearl Harbor) as a day that shall live in infamy, even as "general amnesty" punningly and absurdly reappears as "general honesty." At the same time, Ashbery's "story-line" alludes to the drive toward epiphany so characteristic of Kenyon Review short stories ("The sparks it strikes illuminate the table"), as well as to the master narrative of the period which was relentlessly Freudian, authoritatively guiding those ways in which "we truly behave," even as the movies increasingly guided the ways in which we looked. There is not an image in Ashbery's poem that we haven't seen somewhere else (think of all the fifties movies where a train chuffs into town, purportedly bringing "joy"), not an image that hasn't been recycled from another unnamed source. And the laughing cadets serve as a reminder of military operations, of the boy soldiers about to given a schedule, but for what? It seems that even here war is not so far away.

Ashbery's lines are ungainly, his language like "Terrific units" designedly anti-poetic. Allusion, used pointedly and sparingly in poems of the Wilbur tradition, is now the very fabric of the poem--everything alludes to something, if you can find out what it is. Note that unlike Wilbur, Ashbery makes no claim to know "the things of the world"; indeed, things have become so much "canal machinery," as equivocal as Robert Frank's quite literal but ultimately opaque images. Unlike the Ginsberg of Howl or the O'Hara of Lunch Poems, Ashbery does not place himself at the center of the poem. "I" becomes "we" becomes "you." The subjectivity of the poet is thus everywhere and nowhere, which is another way of saying it is inextricable from the poetic language itself. Perhaps, in the wake of "Wise Man of the Month" discourse, this was the most adequate way of coming to terms with a public sphere as baffling as it was impenetrable.

Ashbery's lyric mode in this, the very first of the texts in his Selected Poems (a mode, incidentally, that has not changed significantly over the years) has enormous implications for the poetry of our own time, although it is only fair to say that in the nineties, as in the fifties, the dominant poetic paradigm is not unlike the Wilbur model (or module), with its drive toward profundity, its desire to "say something" about body and soul, love and war. The later fifties mark, in this respect, an important turning point. In 1956, we might say, public spectacle, especially as filtered through the media, had become at once so threatening and yet so remote that the easiest poetic (or artistic) path was to pretend none of the negative symptoms existed. Didn't The Family of Man prove that love, childbirth, illness, and death were the same the world over? And weren't those elaborate conceits treasured by mainstream poets timeless and universal?

In this context, counterculture poetics could only respond with what was quite literally an opening, but no more than an opening, of the field. Questions of politics were neither dramatized as, say, in Yeats's great "Easter 1916," which was, after all, an insider's view of the "Irish Question," nor used parabolically as in Auden's poems of the early forties. Rather, the political was internalized, whether in the campy rhetoric of Ginsberg's "America," or in O'Hara's unwillingness to rationalize everyday experience, or in the complex parodic versions of Ashbery's "'They Dream Only of America'," poems, where the political is always present, "if you can find out what it is." In this sense, oppositional poetry of the fifties was cool rather than hot, mordant and witty performance rather than its more contemplative, engaged, and analytical European counterpart, as found, say, in the lyric of Paul Celan or Ingeborg Bachmann. War as daily reality (rather than as newspaper report or speculation about nuclear testing) seemed very far away. Thus, when actual revolutionary struggles occurred, as they did in Montgomery in January and in Hungary in October of '56, the poets seemed to be looking in some other direction. Rather like the riders on the trolley in Robert Frank's great photograph, looking out with rapt attention at the images going by, but remaining, at least for the moment, "a step away from them.

### What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Poetry--Some Aporias of Literary Journalism by Marj

Grub Street and the Ivory Tower: as my fellow essayists have so elegantly demonstrated, the worlds of literary journalism and literary scholarship have been, for at least the past two centuries, much more closely allied than is commonly thought. But what about the third term in the equation, the literary itself? Specifically--and this is my subject here--how does "literary journalism" confront the poetry written in its own time, along with the scholarly reception and theorization of that poetry?

Writing about poetry and poetics has, for a long time now, occupied an anomalous place in the larger humanistic discourse in which it is, after all, embedded. Take, for example, two long reviews that appeared just a few months apart in the Times Literary Supplement. The first is Richard Sennett's review of four books on contemporary architectural theory (18 September 1992, pp. 3-4), the second Glyn Maxwell's review of eight books on contemporary poetics (29 January 1993, pp. 9-10).

Richard Sennett is a well-known social critic (currently professor of sociology and humanities at New York University) whose most recent book The Conscience of the Eye (1991) is subtitled The Design and Social Life of Cities. The books under review in this, a special issue on "Cities", which also features articles by Gavin Stamp, David Rieff, and Saskia Sassen, are Jean-Louis Cohen's Le Corbusier and the Mystique of the USSR: Theories and Projects for Moscow, 1928-1936 (Princeton, 1991), Robert Harbison's The Built, the Unbuilt, and the Unbuildable (Thames and Hudson, 1992), Beatriz Colomina's collection, Sexuality and Space (Princeton, 1992), and Anthony Vidler's The Architectural Uncanny (MIT, 1992). Sennett writes about these books as an informed insider: he has himself been active in the symposia held at the Princeton University School of Architecture, where some of the material in question has been aired. He takes it as a given that urban spaces are now largely disaster areas but argues that architects are neither to blame for this state of affairs nor can they be expected to come up with blueprints for some kind of Utopian renewal. Rather, he suggests, in sympathy with the theorists under review, what is needed at the moment is perhaps a better understanding of how these spaces actually work, how buildings, streets, and open spaces relate to the human body.

Cohen's book on Le Corbusier supplies Sennett with his historical frame, for it details the great architect's design for the proposed Palace of the Soviets in Moscow, a design based on the attempt to integrate inside and outside, built from to its surrounding space so as to downplay ceremony and create a truly popular architecture. The rejection of the plan by the authorities in 1932 "in favour of a standard-issue monument in neo-Palladian style by Zhotovsky" is taken, both by Cohen and by Sennett, as emblematic of the aporias of trying to invent a genuinely "popular" form of architecture. Perhaps, then, as Robert Harbison and the contributors to Sexuality and Space argue, the best that buildings can do is to create what Harbison calls "fictions of value." Harbison "sees the experience of industrial ruin as inviting a radically innovative response"; in the case of Richard Rogers's Lloyds Building, for example, the elaborate "mock-ruins", unexpectedly built from steel and glass, have a curious way of altering our sense of time. And Anthony Vidler's Architectural Uncanny (a book that has since become celebrated in discussions of the postmodern arts) carries this notion one step further. To counter the deadness of contemporary neutralized urban spaces, Vidler suggests, one must open oneself to the "uncanny" of crossings, must try to open up the suburb, the strip, the urban centre to one another and see what their intersection will produce. Loss, dislocation, invasion: these become positive values.

Another reviewer might have been less sympathetic to his subjects than is Sennett, but I think most readers would agree that his is an interesting, sophisticated, well-informed review that helps a non-professional reader like myself to understand what's going on in recent urban theory. And Sennett's knowledge of the social context, his own participation in the debate on what to do with urban spaces, makes him an excellent expositor.

Glyn Maxwell sees his role rather differently. The books that he was assigned to review are, in all fairness, as curious an assortment of apples and oranges as one can imagine. (1) First, two critical studies of of established poets: The Art of Derek Walcott, a collection of essays edited by Stuart Brown (Seren, 1989) and James Booth's monograph Philip Larkin, Writer (Harvester, 1992). Next, a biography, A. T. Tolley's, My Proper Ground: A Study of the Work of Philip Larkin and its Development (Edinburgh, 1992). These three are followed by three more theoretical works: Linda Reinfeld's Language Poetry: Writing as Rescue (Louisiana, 1992), Charles Bernstein's A Poetics (Harvard, 1992), and Anthony Easthope and John O. Thompson's Contemporary Poetry Meets Modern Theory (Harvester, 1991). These three books are related: the poet Charles Bernstein's manifestos, theoretical prose poems, and cultural explorations collected in A Poetics stand behind Linda Reinfeld's analytical history of the Language Poetry movement in the U.S. and Easthope and Thompson, for their part, have brought together a variety of critics who hold the common view that the more radical poetries today have much in common with poststructuralist theory. The three, in any case, have nothing in common with the Walcott and Larkin studies on the one hand or with Robert Pack's The Long View: Essays on the Discipline of Hope and Poetic Craft (Massachusetts, 1991), on the other. Pack is an American poet who has been around for a long time and is best known as an anthologist. His essays are avowedly personal, impressionistic, and casual. Finally, the review includes a study of Emersonian-Jamesian poetics by one of the distinguished academic critics in the U.S., Richard Poirier. His book is called Poetry and Pragmatism (Faber, 1992).

Unlike the four books reviewed by Sennett, which are closely related, both historically and ideologically, Maxwell's list thus has no rationale, except that somehow all eight books (published, incidentally, over a four-year period) have some bearing on contemporary poetry, whatever that is. One should note that Maxwell is given some four columns to cover eight books, as against the six columns allotted to Sennett. More important: whereas Sennett is on a par with the authors he reviews, having written comparable books and essays as a fellow-worker in the field, Maxwell has been assigned this review in his capacity, not as poetry critic or scholar or theorist, but as a poet. Indeed, it has become increasingly common, in literary journalism, for theoretical and historical studies of poetry, like Reinfeld's and Poirier's, to be reviewed (when they are reviewed at all) by certified poets. (A certified poet is one who has published a book or two of poems with a mainstream publisher and has received a few respectful reviews in the mainstream press). The parallel, in the case of the architecture books, would be to have an architect, perhaps a partner in a respected firm that specializes in office buildings on Park Avenue or in suburban tract housing, review Anthony Vidler's Architectural Uncanny.

Maxwell begins with a set of assumptions: (1) the "great poem" induce[s] strong, conflicting emotions in every reader who reads it in its language; (2) "it is always instantly memorized"; (3) once its author is dead, it quickly gets overinterpreted, has meanings read into it, and a myth of its author comes into being that threatens to displace the "authentic" poet who wrote it; (4) "Poets know what is worth saying about other poets"; and (5) the concept of "schools" is "especially unhelpful." All these theorems are put before us as if they were simply a matter of common-sense, even though critical theory of the past half century has dismantled, step by step, the notion of the authentic ur-poem, destroyed by later misreadings, the poem as catharsis of "conflicting emotions" (shades of I. A. Richards!), best understood by other poets. As for the memorability criterion, which Maxwell puts forward as if it were the second law of thermodynamics, this criterion allows for neither free verse (hard to memorize!), nor prose poetry or visual poetries--all of them very prominent and exciting today. Memorability depends, of course, on rhyme and meter; it's much easier to memorize Don Juan than The Prelude, Emily Dickinson's short hymn stanzas than Whitman's long poems, Robert Frost than William Carlos Williams. And how would one "memorize" Ian Hamilton Finlay's poetic compositions? Or Susan Howe's?

Maxwell doesn't worry about such thorny issues. He knows what he likes and the books on Walcott and Larkin are deemed worthy, not because their contributors are doing anything special, but because Walcott and Larkin are worthy. The reviewer doesn't worry much about them, nor about Pack and Poirier (the latter gets rather short shrift), his witty barbs being reserved for the so-called language poets discussed by Linda Reinfeld, by some of Anthony Easthope's contributors, and by Charles Bernstein, himself one of the founders of the movement. Maxwell doesn't like the concept of the movement or school, which animates Reinfeld's discussion of language poetry, but he never bothers to investigate if the poets in question--Bernstein, Howe, Michael Palmer, Lyn Hejinian, Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman-- do, in fact, constitute one. Never mind: the main thing is that these, to Maxwell, self-evidently worthless poets continue to write about each other "long after the magazine that gave them their name [L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E] has disappeared, along with any likelihood of anyone else taking an interest." And further: theirs is a poetry of "complete and deliberate impenetrability", a poetry that "jettison[s] the notion that language can communicate." The twin goals of poetry--to teach and to delight--are thus totally violated.

Richard Sennett, you will recall, is himself engaged in the discourse about the future of urban spaces which preoccupies his authors; he writes as a critical but sympathetic insider. Glyn Maxwell has no such commitment to his subjects. On the contrary, he gives no evidence that he has ever read a single poem by Charles Bernstein or the other poets Reinfeld discusses; indeed, it is doubtful that he has so much as looked at A Poetics, since Bernstein's arguments are cited only from Reinfeld's book, as if her account, which is after all an interpretation of Bernstein's theory, were simply equivalent to it. As for the Easthope-Thompson volume, I can testify to the fact that he hasn't read my own essay in that collection, of which he writes, "Elsewhere, Marjorie Perloff celebrates the brick wall of Steve McCaffery's work by invoking Ezra Pound- odd how these radical, dethroning writers will gulp whole the dicta ('Make it new!') of an old apologist for fascism." Period. My essay on McCaffery's Lag never mentions Pound's name nor do I say anything in it about "Make it new!" But even if I did, the assumption that a Pound echo in McCaffery would somehow link this poet to fascism takes one's breath away. And, incidentally, how and why is McCaffery's poem a "brick wall"? Is it enough merely to so pronounce?

Maxwell's is thus a review that blithely ignores the facts, not to mention the poetic principles involved. The reviewer's assertion that "no one" takes an interest in the language poetry movement is belied by so many articles, books, and symposia, not only in the U.S. but also in the U.K. (as in France, China, Japan, and Australia) that the statement hardly warrants serious rebuttal. Indeed, this review would hardly be worth talking about, were it not so typical. For the fact is that whereas TLS reviews of books on architectural theory, on feminist studies, on the Elizabethan theatre, or on philosophy (in the same issue, Arthur Danto has a brilliant, excoriating piece on Charles Taylor's Ethics of Authenticity) are, I would contend, largely responsible pieces, written by experts in their various fields, journalistic discourse about contemporary poetry (perhaps about contemporary literary forms in general) is largely impressionistic, uninformed, and philistine. And the TLS is by no means the worst offender.

Here, for example, is Anthony Libby, a poet-critic who teaches at Ohio State on Stephen Dunn's New and Selected Poems: 1974-94 (Norton, 1994) and Stephen Dobyns's Velocities, New and Selected Poems, 1966-1992 (Viking-Penguin, 1994) in the New York Times Book Review for 15 January 1995:

    Are all the best poems about loss? They are not, probably, about happiness or love's sweet contentment, and the poet who aims to traverse those pleasant territories takes a hard road. . . . The heart of [Dunn's] collection records a long struggle to develop a voice true to Mr. Dunn's simple affirmations and proof against the cynical reader's resistance. . . . [As for Dobyns], His is a more traditional style of masculinity, somewhat cool or repressed, angry, torn by constant awareness that "we are the creatures that love and slaughter". . . . The triumph of Stephen Dobyns's poetry may be that it keeps that sense of play intact, without denying horrors. . . . His quirky imagination affirms by celebrating itself, if not the dark and clouded world. (2)



What is this supposed to mean? Why should the "quirky imagination" of our time "celebrate itself"? Why do we want poetry that conveys a "somewhat cool or repressed masculinity"? And do we in fact need poetry to tell us that "'we are creatures that love and slaughter'"?

Or, to take a third example, consider the poet David Kirby's review of Marilyn Hacker's Selected Poems, 1965-1990 (Norton, 1994), again in the New York Times Book Review (12 March 1995). Kirby begins by announcing, "The history of recent literature is the history of the phrase 'Only connect.' Writers and readers have taken these words from E. M. Forster's 'Howard's End' as an exhortation, with 'only' meaning 'merely' or perhaps 'exclusively'" (NYTBR 6). Those of us who don't quite subscribe to the notion that American poetry in the 1990s is written under the sign of E. M. Forster needn't worry. The reference functions merely as an acceptable literary lead-in, and Kirby quickly moves on to his more personal impressions: "At a time when so many writers seem to be measuring life from a considerable remove, it is invigorating to watch Marilyn Hacker glad-handing her way through the world with a warm facility. And a formalism so colloquial as to undo any readerly stereotypes"(6).

The New York Times Book Review has been castigated for not devoting enough space to poetry. I recently received a letter from a well-meaning New Yorker, asking me to sign a petition demanding that the number of poetry reviews be increased. True, the percentage is shockingly low: for the period January-June 1995, of approximately 500 reviews, only five or 1% deal with new poetry. But quantity, I have come to conclude, is not the answer. Indeed, I shall argue here, if the discourse on poetry in the popular press can't be better than the examples I've just given, I for one would prefer a moratorium on the half-hearted attempt to include, for the sake of some residual notion of "culture", the occasional poetry review along with the occasional poem, the latter invariably presented inside a box as if to cordon it off from more important matters. But my modest proposal is not as pessimistic as it may sound. For I also want to suggest that the abysmal state of poetry reviewing in the popular press is not, paradoxically, hurting the cause of poetry itself, which is, to my mind, extraordinarily healthy at the moment. Rather, there seems to be a mechanism at play that is making "literary journalism" fairly irrelevant so far as contemporary literary production is concerned. It is this mechanism I want to explore below.


HISTORY LESSONS

Was poetry reviewing better in the Good Old Days? Is it only in recent years, thanks to the increasing commodification of our culture, that poetry seems to have no place in the public arena? Conservative critics like Dana Gioia would have us think so, (3) but a statistical survey of actual book reviewing tells us otherwise. My examples here are taken from what are generally regarded as the two leading book reviews in the United States: the popular New York Times Book Review, at this writing exactly a hundred years old, still the review that can make or break a book so far as sales are concerned, and the New York Review of Books, which began publication in 1963 in response to to the extended strike at the New York Times, and quickly established itself as the intellectuals' book review of choice.

The first issue of The New York Times Book Review (subsequently cited as NYTBR) appeared on 10 October 1896 as what was then called the Saturday Book Review Supplement. Its avowed purpose, according to Francis Brown's introductory essay for the Arno Press Reprint of 1968, was "to bring to readers news of books, news of authors, news of publishing, literary news of all kinds." (4) In 1896, this last category included such things as "reports on the state of Oscar Wilde in Reading Gaol." Indeed, there are continuing reports, throughout 1897, on Wilde's condition, which is declared "beyond human endurance", and his consequent turn to spirituality (see Rowland Strong in the 12 June1897 issue). Reviewing was thus a form of reporting, its avowed aim being, as Brown puts it, "to help the reader and buyer, not the writer or publisher." The reviewer thus has the interests of the non-specialist reader in mind; he (the pronoun is used generically) functions as "his reader's guide, philosopher and friend. It is his business to say of new books what there is in them in such wise that his reader may learn whether the book under notice will probably interest him. Knowledge, equity and candor are the chief elements in the equipment of the book reviewer."

Two assumptions govern these and related statements. First, it was assumed that objective judgments on books could be made by more or less anonymous impersonal reviewers. (In the early years, the front page leader was in fact anonymous). And second, it was taken for granted that a review of "literature" was just that--a review of novels, poems, plays, perhaps belles-lettres, not, as is typical today, books on political, historical, psychological, anthropological subjects, on current events, and especially biographies. Reminiscing about the pre-World War I years, Brown writes:

    In retrospect these were great literary years, these years before World War I. In verse, names were being made that would dominate for a long time to come: Yeats and Masefield, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Edward Arlington Robinson. In the novel it was the age of Conrad and Thomas Mann, Galsworthy, Anatole France, the still unappreciated Dreiser. Willa Cather wrote 'O Pioneers', D. H. Lawrence, 'Sons and Lovers', and there was always Mrs. Wharton. Kipling in 1907 received a Nobel Prize at 42. (Introduction, unpaginated)


The canon would not be described all that differently today. And Brown is also proud to note that in 1922 NYTBR pronounced Joyce's Ulysses "the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature in the twentieth century" and that Proust's Swann's Way received high marks. In the 6 Feb.1897 issue, Paul Lawrence Dunbar's Lyrics of Lowly Life, published by Dodd, Mead & Co. with an intoduction by W. D. Howells received extravagant (and anonymous) praise for its wit, keen satire, subtle humor, and "rich colours." Richard Le Gallienne (himself a poet, reviewing Dunbar's Complete Poems on 18 January 1914 went even further: the poems, he declared, "have a certain classical rank in American literature by virtue of an excellence which is in need of no allowances on account of the poet's race." Dunbar's is an "authentic achievement which must give him a high and permanent place among the dialect poets of the world", and such poems as "The Debt", written in standard English are also singled out for praise and cited in full. One would be hard put to find a an African-American poet today who has received this sort of attention in the Times.

But lest we wax nostalgic, it was also true that reviewing as spreading-the-word (more blurb than critique) ran into trouble as the volume of books increased sharply after World War I. And not just their volume but their variety. In 1909, after all, F. T. Marinetti had managed to get his first Futurist manifesto published on the front page of the Paris Figaro, where its competition is little more than the race-track news, the stock-market quotations, and the society news. After the war--a watershed for book reviews as for so much else--a larger literate (and voting) population demanded more political, historical, and social coverage, in reviews as in news articles and editorials. At the same time Modernist poetry seemed highly obscure. The Waste Land (1922), for example, could not be processed as readily as could the collections of short lyric poems to which audiences were accustomed, even if those poems were, like Dunbar's, by a black man. Eliot's long collage-poem, with its foreign phrases and fussy footnotes was not reviewed at all in NYTBR. By this time, in any case, books no longer meant just literary books On 6 January 1924, for example, the front page of the now larger (thanks to increasing advertising space) book review was devoted to a French memoir, the former premier and war minister Paul Painlévé's Comment j'ai nommé Foch et Petain. The same issue has a review of Count Burian's memoir of the Kaiser Franz Joseph and of Bertrand Russell's ABC of Atoms. And by the early 1930s, the basic blueprint and layout that characterizes the NYTBR to this day was in place. The lead article (on the cover, usually with a large photograph at the center) tended to be a review of a "major new novel" or of a large-scale historical/social critique. On 14 January 1934, for example, the leader is a review of Pearl Buck's The Mother; on 28 January, Sinclair Lewis's Work of Art, on 4 February, Phyllis Bentley's A Modern Tragedy (with the headline "A Novel that Clarifies Our Age"), and on Feb. 11, Oswald Spengler's The Hour of Decision.

Big novels, big ideas! What happens to poetry or to the more avant-garde literary productions in this context. Poetry could hardly be eliminated, a neoVictorian, neoRomantic culture continuing to demand its "higher" presence, even as it does in today's New Yorker, New Republic, or Atlantic. But as slender books of poems continued to proliferate, the group review became normative, one of the reviewer's chief tasks thus being to find a common thread like Kirby's "Only connect." The reviewers tended to be themselves minor poets or, as in the founding days of NYTBR, professional reporters. Certainly there was no precedent for asking a poetry specialist (e.g., an English professor) to review these books. For poetry--and this bias is still with us--is something "everyone" can more or less talk about. We all, after all, know what it is when we see it and many of us write it for birthdays, weddings, or just to please ourselves. Jimmy Carter is a case in point. "I have always found it possible", said Carter on the occasion of his best-selling Always a Reckoning (New York: Random House 1995), "to say things in my poems that would have been impossible to say in prose." Things like how sad he was to have to kill his aged dog:

    Yesterday I killed him. I had known

    for months I could not let him live. I might

    have paid someone to end it, but I knew

    that after fifteen years of sharing life

    the bullet ending his must be my own. (5)


Try saying that bit of blank verse in prose! The newspaper reviewers did not wish to be harsh. And soon Jimmy Carter was embarking on a book tour around the U.S. and to Dylan Thomas's Wales.

The 14 January 1934 issue (the one with J. Donald Adams' review of Pearl Buck's The Mother on the cover), typically has a full-page article on "Six New Books of Verse by a Diversity of Poets." Among the poets are Kimi Gengo, Adelaide Love, C. Arthur Coan, and Mary Owens Lewis. The reviewer Percy Hutchinson praises the poems in Adelaide Love's The Slender Singing Tree (its "highly engaging title" is remarked upon) which are "written with skill against a background of deep thought." He cites "The Lien":

    Relentless press of little things;

    Eternal haste to do them all;

    The prior claim upon our days

    Relinquished to the trivial.

    Our obligations never paid

    But endless and imperative.

    O life, why must you always leave

    So little time to live?


"Somehow", remarks Hutchinson, "this seems to us the possible utterance of a disciplined Emily Dickinson. Not, of course, that the real Emily could ever have been disciplined, either as to thought or poetic utterance. . . . But . . . the Amherst spinster-poet must ever stand symbolically for her sex's expression of itself in poetry. Thus it seems to us that Adelaide Love carries on what might be termed the Emily Dickinson tradition, that is, she expresses herself fragmentarily while seeing with inclusive vision, and plucks at the heart-strings, but always with the most gentle touch, perceiving and transferring beauty" (p. 14).

From our vantage point sixty years later, we can laugh at the very idea of Adelaide Love's little jingle being compared (not unfavorably!) to the work of the, alas, "undisciplined" Emily Dickinson. But the problems of poetry reviewing confronting Percy Hutchinson were not all that different from those experienced by David Kirby in his review of Marilyn Hacker or even by Glynn Maxwell in his omnibus piece for the TLS. The mandate--to say something telling and original about five or ten unlike and generally unexceptional volumes of short personal lyrics--is not easy to fulfill. We can see this even in the more specifically literary journals like the Georgia Review or the Hudson Review. Consider an article in PN Review 80 (1991), in which T. J. G. Harris discusses Michael Hulse's Eating Strawberries in the Necropolis and Andrew Motion's Love in a Life, along with the first book, Tale of the Mayor's Son, by the very Glyn Maxwell who wrote that snide review for TLS. Maxwell, being the newcomer in this group, gets one long paragraph:

Glynn Maxwell combines strictness of form with abrupt arbitrariness, a kind of headlong, thrown-together, jagged improvisation that, if it often has small attraction for the ear, certainly has, as Joseph Brodsky remarks on the back of the book, a 'propulsion . . ., owing in part to his tendency to draw metaphor from the syntax itself'. But the propulsion is not so often real as apparent, and one has the frequent impression that a device (a tricky self-reference or address to the reader, a drawing of metaphor from syntax, a blatant obscurity of one kind or another--of which there are far too many) has been thrown in not so much to keep something going as to stop it from flagging. The 'propulsion' also makes reading this book, which would have been better shorter, a wearying--and not, as it should be, an exhilerating-- experience, since everything starts sounding the breathless, edgy same as it whoops and echoes in the ear's labyrinth. Maxwell needs an editor. But he is good at creating an atmosphere of arbitrary urban or suburban menace, and he can be funny. One senses a definite and characteristic style coming clear in this, his first book. (6)

This may have a more sophisticated patina than a comparable review in NYTBR, but what is it we really learn about Glyn Maxwell from Harris's review? Primarily that the book has the imprimatur of Joseph Brodsky, which probably accounts for its having been published by Bloodaxe in the first place What else does Harris tell us? Well, that Maxwell opts for "strictness of form" although that term is never specified. What is "strict" form? Quatrains? Sonnets? Blank verse? Sestinas? Canzones? Haiku or renga? And if "jagged improvisation" is confined within strict forms is it still improvisation? Further: if Maxwell is, as Harris implies, tricky and needlessly obscure, how and where is he "funny"? But the most puzzling phrase in this review is the reference to that "atmosphere of arbitrary urban or suburban menace", which Maxwell is evidently so "good at creating." Does this mean he is not good at creating an atmosphere of rural menace? Lambs stolen by vicious vagrants? Cows on speed jumping over fences? Or does he mean that Maxwell does not take on the menace of wild, untramelled nature? Of fire and flood and earthquake? But then what English poet today does write about these subjects? Urban or suburban--that about covers the menace most of Maxwell's readers are likely to have experienced.

The New York Review of Books, to which I now turn, does not go in for this sort of empty impressionism. Its own solution (and LRB's is similar) is to limit the list of reviewable poets, confining itself to a very small circle and then devoting long, individual reviews to its members. From its inception in 1963, NYRB has limited itself largely to the poetry of Robert Lowell (the then-husband of Elizabeth Hardwick, one of NYRB's founding editors) and to the Lowell circle that includes John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, Randall Jarrell, Sylvia Plath, and James Merrill. Auden is an elder statesman who belongs to the group as is, at the other end of the age-scale, Adrienne Rich. A few British poets--Seamus Heaney, Philip Larkin, Thom Gunn, later James Fenton-- have been invited to join the club along with Americans on the circle's fringes like Theodore Roethke, W. S. Merwin and Howard Nemerov. Helen Vendler, a regular NYRB reviewer, has tried to bring John Ashbery into the fold, but Ashbery seems not to be taken very seriously by such other NYRB poetry reviewers as Denis Donoghue and Frank Kermode; a number of his recent books have not been reviewed in NYRB at all.

However this parochialism may have been justified in the sixties and seventies --and bear in mind that NYR studiously ignored the Objectivists (Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, Lorine Niedecker), the Beats, the Black Mountain and San Francisco poets, as well as John Cage, Ian Hamilton Finlay, and any number of Dada, Surrealist, and Fluxus poets-- it has become, in the mid-nineties, a way of denying poetry its very life. For most of the above are now safely dead, and where are the young who should replace them? Has time simply stopped so that "poetry" can mean no more than a review of Elizabeth Bishop's posthumously published letters or an obituary essay about James Merrill? So, much of today's "literary journalism" would have us believe. In a recent article in The Economist (8 July 1995, p. 82), for example, we are told that "[America']s poetic voice has shrunk to a whisper", that "Since the death of Robert Lowell in 1977, America seems to have lacked a major poet. In fact most people are not even aware of the concerns of American poets these days. It has declined into a minor art, subsidised principally by universities." The occasion for these ruminations is the publication by prestigious Faber & Faber of three younger (actually not so young) American poets: Charles Simic, Chase Twitchell, and August Kleinzahler. But since these are (rightly, to my mind) discovered to be not all that remarkable, the anonymous Economist writer feels the point has been proved.

The reasoning here is purely circular. If Chase Twitchell "represents" the New American Poetry, then the New American Poetry can't be very good, right? And since, so many of us would argue, even Robert Lowell can't represent great American poetry quite as convincingly as did Walt Whitman or Emily Dickinson or T. S. Eliot --well, then, things are really pretty bad, aren't they? Thus, while the New York Review of Books and TLS pay careful attention to the New Historicism, the New Gender Criticism, or the New Cultural Studies, they pay no comparable attention--indeed, no attention at all--to the New Poetics. Let us consider why this is the case.


POETRY DEGREE ZERO

Suppose a reviewer is assigned to write a piece on Renaissance New Historicist studies. He or she knows (or quickly learns) that the founding father of this movement is Stephen Greenblatt, a professor at Berkeley, whose new book is to be discussed in the review along with others by Thomas Lacqueur, Richard Helgerson, and Nancy Vickers. The reviewer reads "background" material, considers opposing views, and is ready to write the piece. A similar process takes place when a reviewer takes on, say, the most recent book by Jean-François Lyotard or Helène Cixous.

But--and here's the rub--what is poetry anyway? Does anyone have a clear idea? The problem is not insurmountable if the review is to be of Milton or Eliot or even H.D. studies, for these canonical authors at least partially provide norms against which books about their oeuvre will be judged. But Charles Bernstein? Charles Wright? Charles Simic? Who knows what is to be looked for in the case of their books?

A further complication has been produced by the relative positioning of poetry and theory in the university curriculum of the past few decades. We expect graduate students in English or Comparative Literature to be familiar with Saussure's distinction between signifier and signified, Roman Jakobson's distinction between metaphor and metonymy, with Lacan's elaboration on that distinction, and Paul De Man's related discussion of irony and allegory. The "death of the author," as defined by Barthes and Foucault is now a common topic of discussion. Judith Butler's notions of "gender performativity" are regularly cited as are Fredric Jameson's interpretations of consumer culture and Homi K. Bhabha's theories on the hybridity and porosity of nations. But when the book to be discussed is a book of poems, the reader suddenly seems to forget everything he or she has learned about literariness, about the cultural construction of the subject, the naturalisation of ideology, and the relation of genre to gender. The fairly simple principle that the choice of verse form is never merely arbitrary, that one doesn't just "at will" write sonnets on Monday, fragmented free verse on Tuesday, and prose on Wednesday is largely ignored, as is the twin question why poet X--say, Philip Larkin- never wrote prose poetry. And beyond the individual poet, what about period style? National or ethnic styles? Are the "affirmations" of a "quirky imagination" the same in 1990 as they were when Wordsworth wrote "Resolution and Independence"?

A sense of history and a sense of theory: these are the twin poles of criticism missing from most poetry discourse today and hence missing in the typical poetry review. Poet X, we read regularly, "has found his voice." But is his voice one worth finding? Poet Y never lets her formalism get in the way of the colloquial. But why do we want poetry to be colloquial? "There is a distinct world in Michael Longley's poetry", writes his fellow poet Eavan Boland, "He has created it from a sense of lost values, out of lyric irony, and with a considerable fortitude." (7) But in most discourses today the very idea of a "distinct world" is suspect, and as for those "values" to be recovered with "considerable fortitude",maybe it would be better if they were "lost."

The poetry review (one poet reviewing another) comes, directly or indirectly, out of the poetry workshop, and the poetry workshop (or, for that matter, the creative writing workshop in general) is still dominated by a regressively Romantic concept of the poet as a man speaking to men (or woman speaking to women--the principle is the same), by the notion that poetry is emotion recollected in tranquillity, the poet speaking for all of us--only more sensitively, perceptively, and expertly. And how could the workshop be otherwise without going out of existence? How could it not be based on the assumption that a given student just might have "talent", that that talent needs to find a conduit of expression and then he or she can become a certified poet. One writes on a given subject or uses a given verse form, the instructor and one's fellow students provide constructive criticism and, if one is diligent and lucky, poems are born--and published in American Poetry Review.

Ironically this workshop / journalism discourse is wholly at odds, not only with the discourses of architecture, anthropology, social science, and philosophy, but also with the amazing body of writing on poetics (often by poets themselves) throughout our century.. From Roman Jakobson's brilliant study of Khlebnikov called New Russian Poetry (1921), Ezra Pound's "How to Read"(1928), and Gertrude Stein's How to Write (1931), to the Concrete Poetry manifestos of the 1950s, produced by the Noigandres group in Brazil, to John Cage's Silence (1962) and A Year From Monday (1969), Ingeborg Bachmann's Wir müssen wahre Sätze finden (1983), and Susan Howe's The Birthmark (1993), we have an exciting body of poetics, a discourse on poetry impressive in its richness and excitement. This is not to say that there is large-scale agreement between individual poet-theorists, but what can be said is that, from Futurism and Dada on down, the international poetic impetus has been constructivist rather than expressivist: it is committed, in other words, to the basic theorem that poetry is the language art, the art in which the "what" cannnot be separated from "how", in which the said exists only in the saying. In his widely discussed "Artifice of Absorption" (reprinted in A Poetics), Charles Bernstein calls this quality the "non-absorbability" of poetic discourse. But then Yeats had already said as much when he declared that "Our words must seem to be inevitable." At the same time--and here is a corollary principle about which there's little disagreement in the arena of poetics (as compared to the arena of poetic journalism)-- poetic language is never simply unique, natural, and universal; it is the product, in large part, of particular social, historical, and cultural formations. And these formations demand study.

There is, then, no good intellectual reason why poetry reviewing in, say, the TLS, couldn't be just as useful and interesting as reviews of urban or gender studies. But--and here we have to consider the larger cultural landscape --it's not likely to happen in our culture because, to put it bluntly, there isn't enough at stake. As long as self-proclaimed poets appear on the scene in every city and small town in Britain or America --and, oddly enough, poetry still has enough cultural capital for this to be the case (8) --as long as the editors of NYTBR, NYRB TLS, and so on have to choose books to be reviewed from a wide variety of disciplines and areas, there is no way to weed out the dross, which is about 90% of so-called poetry publication. Who, we say democratically and bravely, is to decide which of the countless poets now plying their trade are worthy of attention? And why is one set of poetic principles--say, the ones I've just adumbrated above--any more "valid" than another?

Notice we never say this about historians or anthropologists--or even architects, perhaps because certification in these fields is a complex process. A given architect or architecture critic might, for example, personally dislike the work of Frank Gehry or of Denise Scott-Brown. But that work won't be dismissed by reviewers as simply unimportant or irrelevant. In poetry journalism, however, it happens all the time: witness James Fenton's "Getting Rid of the Burden of Sense", a review of John Ashbery's Selected Poems (1985) in NYTBR (29 December 1985, p. 10). The poet, declares Fenton, "ask[s] of the reader impossible feats of attention . . . yielding only a minimum of reward." And he confesses that "There were times during my reading of this 'Selected Poems' (a gathering from 30 years' work) when I actually thought I was going to burst into tears of boredom."


NEW THRESHOLDS, NEW ANATOMIES

What, in the face of such arbitrary and subjective judgment, can be done to strengthen critical writing about poetry? A lot, actually, but perhaps no longer in the popular literary press. In the last decade or so, thanks to the world of the internet and hyperspace, of desktop publishing and small press production, poetry, as even the newspapers keep telling us, is once more a widely practiced and popular art form, and the discourse about it is becoming much more interesting. A case in point is a large, glossy-paged volume called Exact Change Yearbook no. 1: Yearbook 1995, edited by a young poet named Peter Gizzi, who received his training in the Buffalo Poetics Program from Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, and Robert Creeley, and is co-published by Exact Change in Boston and the Carcanet Press in the UK. Its elegant and perhaps too extravant layout has been executed by a team of production assistants and printed in Hong Kong. Yearbook 1 features Michael Palmer, glamorously pictured on the book's cover and represented by an excellent interview with Peter Gizzi and a twelve-page selection from his work. And--signs of the times-- the Yearbook includes a CD of readings by twelve poets from Palmer to Ted Berrigan (9) and is available for $35 in the U.S., £19.50 in Britain. I bought my copy at the Museum of Contemporary Art bookshop in Los Angeles.

In their prefatory "Publisher's Note", Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang (who doubles as the book's designer) write that they wanted to replace the now defunct New Directions annual (edited for some forty years by James Laughlin) with "a large miscellany of avant-garde work, both contemporary and historical, chosen less to represent a particular 'school', and more in the spirit of learning what's out there." To this end, the publishers asked Gizzi "to help us find a range of contemporary work that draws on the tradition we publish in our books of Surrealist and other early twentieth-century experimentation. . . . To what came back we added work by Exact Change authors [Stein, Cage, de Chirico, Aragon], as well as a few other discoveries we were eager to share."

What makes the project unusual is that it juxtaposes avant-garde poets and artists from the U.S. (ranging chronologically from the Imaginary Elegies of the late Jack Spicer and Fanny Howe's presentation of extracts from John Wiener's very moving journal 707 Scott Street, to a "Gallery" of younger largely unknown poets like Paul Beatty, Tory Dent, and Jennifer Moxley), with their counterparts abroad--specifically, in Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia--and, closer to home, in the Caribbean and Canada. And as if these juxtapositions weren't enough, we can also read, say, Clark Coolidge or Susan Howe against Gertrude Stein's Before the Flowers of Friendship faded Friendship Faded, which is printed for the first time (as Julianna Spahr explains in her headnote), together with Stein's source text, Georges Hugnet's Enfance, exactly in the form they were originally published in the journal Pagany (1930). Or again, we can read Barbara Guest's lecture "Poetry the True Fiction" against Hugo Ball's "Grand Hotel Metaphysics", the "Radio Happenings" of John Cage and Morton Feldman against Erik Satie's "Dried Embryos", Michael Palmer against Louis Aragon's "Peasant's Dream" or the "Fragments" of De Chirico.

Such collaging gives, at least me, a sense of--forgive the taboo word--transcendence. For instead of the usual anthology wars (who's in, who's out, which editor is sufficiently multicultural?) the Exact Change Yearbook offers the most convincing evidence I've seen to date that our own radical poetries are not (as Maxwell or Fenton would have us think) some kind of local aberration, spawned by a bunch of theory-crazed, left-wing poets in New York and San Francisco, and perpetrated by les jeunes at Buffalo and other out-of-the way stations--poetries that deserve simply to be ignored. Indeed, what Gizzi's juxtapositions of U.S. and foreign portfolios suggest is that the attention to the materiality of language I spoke of above, to syntactic disjunction and visual constellation, and especially to the reconfiguration of lyric as speaking, once again, not for the hypothetical "sensitive" and "authentic" individual ("Here's a vision I had as I was weeding the garden yesterday") but for the larger cultural and philosophical moment--that all these are now characteristic of poetries produced around the globe.

Take Jeff Twitchell's portfolio of the "Original Chinese Language Group." As Twitchell explains, "Original, not in the sense of unique, but because of their interest in the earlier meanings and associations that can be read in the Chinese written character. . . .So, too, the recuperation of the original impetus of poetry as the play in language." The "Original Poets", Twitchell notes, go beyond their predecessors, the so-called "Misty" (because branded "obscure" by the official critics) poets of the late 1970s, of whom the best known in the U.S. is Bei Dao. The 1988 "Original" Manifesto, reproduced here, comes out strongly against the localism, ethnocentrism, and nationalism that bedevilled Communist China until quite recently. The aim is to make contact with "modern Western art", and the vehicle for such contact, the manifesto declares, is the written character, which, compared to spoken language, is "less polluted and pre-judged." "We do not avoid", they declare, "the phrase 'word games' which already has aroused great misunderstanding. We even like it. 'Game' [yóuxi] is a word, connoting the profound, eerie spirit of art and philosophy." And the text gives way to the visual image of a large black cross which represents the intersection of "swim" [yóu]--to get in touch with reality-- and "play" [xì].

Twichell's portfolio is taken from the selection that appeared in the British journal Parataxis (#7, 1994), edited by the poet Drew Milne. In translation, the poems themselves--by Che Quian-Zi, Zhou Ya-Ping, Yi Cun, Huang Gan, Xian Meng, and Hong Liu (the one woman in this group)--don't quite live up to that manifesto. (10) "Word games", in the sense of Steve McCaffery's or Charles Bernstein's paragrammatic play, are less common than neo-Surrealist imagery and the casting of a sharp eye on the "direct treatment of the thing," in the Poundian Imagist sense. Just as Pound's fabled "invention of China" turns out to have little to do with the classical Chinese models which were his source, so the Original Poets's version of "language poetry" is more graphic and precisionist than, say, Lyn Hejinian's or Bob Perelman's. Here, for example, is Part III of Zhou Ya-Ping's "Vulgar Beauty":

    An afterbirth is unfolded, taking the shape of an umbrella.

    The ridges of an umbrella along yellow lines.

    A fetus like a coal cinder has long been reared in it,

    Lit by me, it will give off light.

    A white crane, unexpectedly covered by a black string-net

    A snake, bound with a copper wire, body

    Like a tightening spring, soft parts flashing.


We must remember that in the Chinese, as J. H.Prynne notes in his Afterword, the "iconic deployment [of the language] by stroke play and contexture makes a traffic with the eye worked by a different ground-plan." At one point, the translators planned to include some of the Chinese text so as to show how the tactile element works, but the Originals themselves countered this idea because, as Prynne puts it, "it would suggest exoticism or extraneous willow-pattern ornament; to them, we are the exotics, with our credit-card view of the speech act."

That "credit-card view" is satirized in Prynne's own poems in Bands around the Throat, the entire chapbook, originally published in Cambridge in a limited edition, reprinted in the Exact Change Yearbook. And Tom Raworth's "Anglo-Irish Alternative," a portfolio printed elsewhere in the anthology, provides a rich context in which to understand Prynne's work. Such contextualizing (one should certainly read Rosmarie Waldrop's Berlin portfolio "against" Raworth's) provides a kind of information that is absent from the short review, however elegant, of the individual poet. And Gizzi's juxtapositions have their counterpart in a number of recent anthologies. Since 1993 alone, the following have appeared: Eliot Weinberger's, American Poetry Since 1950: Innovators and Outsiders (Marsilio, evidently a best-seller in Mexico in a Spanish edition), Paul Hoover's A Norton Book of Postmodern Poetry (Norton), Douglas Messerli's From the Other Side of the Century: A New American Poetry 1960-90 (Sun & Moon), Volume 1 of Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris's Poems for the Millenium (California), and, most recently, Maggie O'Sullivan's Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America & the UK (Reality Street Editions). Some of these anthologies have barely been reviewed, and yet, in what is a surprising development, they are already being assigned for classroom use and discussed at conferences. Romana Huk, a professor at the University of New Hampshire, for example, has organized an international poetry festival called "Assembling Alternatives," based, in the case of Anglo-American poetry, largely on such yet-to-be-reviewed anthologies and small press books, many of which she came across during a fellowship year in the UK.

But how, it will be asked, is such work disseminated if not via reviews in the major papers? Here is where electronic discussion groups and the internet come in. On the Poetics Discussion Group sponsored at SUNY-Buffalo and open to anyone who hears about it by word of mouth and cares to join, the daily conversation now contains an average of 1200 lines and includes postings from all over the world. Much of the "talk" is trivial: who said what to whom where, what X meant when she said Y, and so on. But there have lately been extended conversations on the nature of free verse, on "close reading" (Peter Quartermain began this one when he asked, on the net, "Why the animus against close reading? Do we want distant and/or careless reading?"), and on the relation of language poetry to other contemporary movements. Bob Perelman's new critical book The Trouble with Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky (California, 1995) has been discussed in a series of postings; indeed, the argument as to what Perelman's book does and what its implications might be, acts as a kind of supplement (in the Derridean sense of addition as well as substitute) for the more conventional book review.

Buffalo also sponsors the Electronic Poetry Center where one can call up, say, an "Authors" file and access an impressive list of poets, each one represented by a photograph, followed by selected poems, prose writings, bibliography, and so on. Then, too, the Electronic Poetry Center publishes its own journal, Rif/t, which contains poems, fictions, critical essays, and reviews as does the on-line Postmodern Culture, published at the University of Virginia. A new group has just been formed in San Francisco that discusses concrete poetry, visual poetics, and language-art relationships; this one is called Majordomo and is accessed by subscribing to something called Wr-eye-tings; a related group is Silence, devoted to the work of the late John Cage; this group is extremely active, sharing information about Cage scores, recordings, musical interpretations, poetic texts, and so on. James Pritchett's recent book on Cage's music (Cambridge, 1994) was discussed and debated in a series of postings.

The "reviewing" that occurs on such lists and in the new e-zines is by no means ideal. Internet reviewers are not likely to be as accountable as are their counterparts in the print media, and editors are not likely to ask for a lot of revisions and fact checks. The ephemerality of the medium controlls the discourse: one flick of the finger, after all, and the text disappears from the screen, perhaps not to be found again. Then, too, onscreen discussion of poetry and poetics is designed for a limited (and largely younger) audience that is at home with the new technologies.

And this raises the spectre of the nominal "public" that, for the past hundred years, has ostensibly depended on reviewers to help it decide what poetry books to read. Doesn't a weekly paper like TLS owe something to this non-professional public, and isn't it therefore better to "cover" a range of books, even as Glyn Maxwell does in his omnibus piece? Two books on Larkin, one on Walcott, some theoretical treatises from the U.S.: why not let the reader decide which ones are worth her while?

My own sense is that this middle-class poetry public no longer exists, that poetics is now at least as specialized as is architectural discourse; indeed, the latter actually speaks to a much wider audience than does poetry, given that everyone lives and works in specific buildings and hence takes an interest in the look and feel of the built environment. In the case of poetry, however, the rapprochement with the university may well be a fait accompli. (11) And thus it is that the TLS or NYRB review may well be on its way toward becoming obsolete.

Take the case of Charles Bernstein's A Poetics, the book Maxwell dismissed so offhandedly. This 1992 collection of "essays" (the first and longest piece "Artifice of Absorption" is, strictly speaking, a verse treatise, written in what is predominantly iambic pentameter) was reviewed neither in NYTBR nor in NYRB, nor in The New Republic, The Village Voice Literary Supplement, or The Washington Post Book World, to mention just the most obvious daily and weekly papers. Yet within two years of its publication, it appeared on course syllabi across the U.S. (and many in the UK and Australia as well), has become a popular item on PhD qualifying exams, and is cited, along with Bernstein's earlier collection of critical prose, Content's Dream (Sun & Moon, 1986), with increasing frequency. The relation of "absorption" to "anti-absorption" in poetry is discussed in learned journals. And A Poetics has now sold some 5,000 copies and has gone through two printings and numerous translations.

How does the process of dissemination work in a case like Bernstein's? How is the readership for such a book constructed? Can the Electronic Poetry Center and other e-zines, together with the more traditional scholarly journals and small poetry magazines in which A Poetics has been reviewed, (12) really make the difference? Or is distribution dependent on word-of-mouth on the campus and at the ever-burgeoning number of conferences? Or controlled by a particular group of fellow-poets, professors, end editors? These are questions I can't yet answer satisfactorily. But what I can say is that literary journalism, as we used to know it and as many of us still practice it, has had nothing to do with the case

### BARBED-WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS_ THE NEW AMERICAN POETRY 1930-32 by Marj



    January 1931. In the "News Notes" at the back of Poetry magazine, Harriet Monroe announced that the February issue would be edited by one "Mr. Louis Zukofsky, who has been for several years a prominent member of a group of writers interested in experiment in poetic form and method. . . . Mr. Zukofsky is recommended on the high authority of Ezra Pound and others whose opinions we greatly respect." (1) But, having "abdicated [her editorial powers] temporarily," Monroe evidently felt betrayed. In the March issue, she wrote an angry response to the "Objectivist" number of Poetry called "The Arrogance of Youth." Zukofsky, she insisted, was wrong to "abandon" such big poetry names as E. A. Robinson, Robert Frost, Edgar Lee Masters, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, as well as the "once-revolutionary imagists." And "what," asks Monroe, "are we offered in exchange? A few familiar names get by [she is evidently thinking of William Carlos Williams's "Botticellian Trees"] though often by severely wrenching Mr. Zukofsky's barbed-wire entanglements." (2)

    What was the nature of the "Objectivist" experiment, as represented by Zukofsky's selection for Poetry, a selection that included, aside from the obvious names (Basil Bunting, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, Zukofsky himself), Robert McAlmon and Kenneth Rexroth, Whittaker Chambers and Henry Zolinsky, John Wheelright and Martha Champion? And in what sense was the work of these poets a departure from that of the "once-revolutionary imagists"? Williams, for one, seems to have been skeptical, even though Zukofsky's "Objectivists" Anthology of the following year contains a large selection of his own poems. "Your early poems," he told Zukofsky in a letter of 1928, "even when the thought has enough force or freshness, have not been objectivized in new or fresh observations. But if it is the music, even that is not inventive enough to make up for images which give an overwhelming effect of triteness. . . . The language is stilted 'poetic' except in the places I marked. Eyes have always stood first in the poet's equipment. If you are mostly ear--a newer rhythm must come in more strongly than has been the case so far." (3)

    As examples of such "stilted 'poetic'" language, Williams singles out the phrases "all live processes," "orbit-trembling," "our consciousness," and "the sources of being" in what he calls Zukofsky's "Lenin poem," "Memory of V. I. Ulianov." (4)"It may be," he admits, "that I am too literal in my search for objective clarities of image. It may be that you are completely right in forcing abstract conceptions into the sound pattern. . . . it may be that when the force of the conception is sufficiently strong it can carry this sort of thing. . . . Perhaps by my picayune, imagistic mannerisms I hold together superficially what should by all means fall apart" (WCWL, 103).

    The recognition that "imagistic mannerisms" may well have had their day is echoed by Ezra Pound. Having urged Harriet Monroe to put Zukofsky "at the wheel of the Spring cruise," as he put it in a letter, and having "refused to contribute to Aldington's Imagist mortology 1930," which he dismisses as "20 ans apres," Pound urges Zukofsky to make his special issue "a murkn number; excludin the so different English." Indeed, if Zukofsky does his job, Pound suggests, Poetry might once again be "what it was in 1912/13, the forum in which the Zeitideen WERE presented and discussed." (5)

    But the "Zeitideen" of 1931 were, as Pound himself was the first to recognize ("Prob[lem] ain't now the same"), no longer those of 1913. For one thing, the relationship between tradition and the new had become vexed. "The number ought to be NEW line up," Pound repeatedly urges Zukofsky. "You can mention me and old Bill Walrus [Williams] in the historic section. . . . I do not think contributions from ANYone over 40 shd. be included; and preferably it shd. be confined to those under 30" (PZ, 51-52). And he notes acutely, "ONE notable difference between yr. position in 1930 and mine in 1910 is that you would LIKE to include several older american authors. Bill, Me and I suppose Possum Eliot, with Cummings an already known name" (PZ, 53).

    Zukofsky responded defensively. "The only progress made since 1912," writes the twenty-six-year-old poet to his forty-six-year-old mentor, "is or are several good poems, i.e. the only progress possible -- & criteria are in your prose works" (PZ, 65). And again, "Think I'll have as good a 'movement' as that of the premiers imagistes-- point is Wm. C. W. of today is not what he was in 1913, neither are you if you're willing to contribute -- if I'm going to show what's going on today, you'll have to. The older generation is not the older generation if it's alive & up. . . . What's age to do with verbal manifestation, what's history to do with it?" (PZ, 67). Which Pound shrugs off laconically: "In 1913 les jeunes did not respect their papas. In 1930 there are a few middle-aged bokos that we can afford to let live" (PZ, 74). It was fine, in other words, for Zukofsky to reprint, in his preface to the "Objectivists" Anthology, Pound's own Imagist manifesto in "A Retrospect" (1912), along with his famous division of poetry into three "kinds" (melopoeia, phanopoeia, logopoeia) articulated in "How to Read" (1928), and to quote the opening of the newly completed Canto XXX ("Compleynt, compleynt I hearde upon a day"). And the Anthology is dedicated to Pound, who "is still for the poets of our time / the / most important."

    A certain sense of belatedness--the belatedness usually associated with our own postmodern ethos--thus haunts Zukofsky's production. But then "make it new!" could hardly be the watchword of a poetic generation that came of age in the Great Depression, a generation that understood that the "new" was by no means equivalent to the true, much less to the good and the beautiful. Just the same, despite Zukofsky's own evident inability to articulate the difference between Pound's aesthetic and that of the "Objectivists" Anthology that he had assembled, there really was something new going on in that anthology, as in the little magazines of the early thirties in general. Indeed, with the hindsight of the 1990s, the early 1930s were anni mirabiles for poetry, as the magazines that now replaced the Dial and Little Review (both ceased publication in 1929)--magazines like Blues, Morada, the New Review, Furioso, New Masses -- testify. The "Objectivists" Anthology, for that matter, far from being the anomaly Zukofsky and Oppen scholars have often taken it to be, was in fact representative of a larger aesthetic that has been insufficiently distinguished from its modernist past and its postmodernist future. The shift that takes place at the turn of the decade is one from the modernist preoccupation with form in the sense of imagistic or symbolist structure, dominated by a lyric "I," to the questioning of representation itself. Discourse now becomes increasingly referential, but reference does not go hand in hand with the expected mimesis. Rather, the boundaries between the "real" and the "fantastic" become oddly blurred. The taste for the "natural," as in Pound's insistence that "The natural object is always the adequate symbol," (6) gives way to artifice and a marked taste for abstraction and conceptualization. In the same vein irony, so central to modernist poetics, gives way to the parodic, but even parody is often not sustained, with abrupt tonal shifts and reversals in mood becoming quite usual. Indeed, this "time of tension," to borrow Eliot's phrase from his 1930 poem "Ash Wednesday," exhibits a mannerist style as distinct from its modernist antecedents as from the socialist realism to come.

    In the discussion that follows, I take as my example a single "little magazine," Pagany, which ran for twelve issues between January 1930 and December 1932, thus coinciding with the darkest years of the Depression, from the October 1929 Wall Street crash to the election of Roosevelt and the coming of his New Deal in 1932. It was in Pagany, edited by an affluent young Boston litterateur named Richard Johns, (7) that Williams published the first ten chapters of White Mule and such famous short lyrics as "Flowers by the Sea" and "The Red Lily"; Stein, the first version of Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded; Pound, Cantos XXX-XXXII as well as critical commentary; and Zukofsky, "A"1. In his capacity as informal poetry advisor, (8) moreover, Zukofsky evidently persuaded Johns to publish poems by his "Objectivist" friends Carl Rakosi, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen, and Basil Bunting, by Kenneth Rexroth and Yvor Winters, Mary Butts and Mina Loy. But Pagany also published such early "naturalist" fiction as Edward Dahlberg's Flushing to Calvary, Erskine Caldwell's American Earth stories, and John Dos Passos's Eveline from U.S.A.

    Johns takes the title of his journal from a work he greatly admired, Williams's autobiographical novel Voyage to Pagany (1928). But whereas Williams's Pagany is of course Europe, the "pagan" Old World where American innocents come to be initiated into the complexities of a sophisticated culture, Johns's Pagany, as the journal's subtitle, "A Native Quarterly," makes clear, neatly reverses this Jamesian contrast between Old and New Worlds. In the Announcement on the opening page of the first issue (January-March1930), Johns explains:

        Pagus is a broad term, meaning any sort of collection of peoples from the smallest district or village to the country as an inclusive whole. Taking America as the pagus, any one of us as the paganus, the inhabitant, and our conceptions, our agreements and disagreements, our ideas, ideals, whatever we have to articulate is pagany, our expression.

        This Native Quarterly is representative of a diverse and ungrouped body of spokesmen, bound geographically. Wary of definite alliance with any formulated standard PAGANY (as an enclosure) includes individual expression of native thought and emotion. (9)

    Here, by an odd sleight-of-hand, Pagany (Europe) becomes the "diverse and ungrouped body of spokesmen" that is America. From the exotic and corrupt European Other to the cultural diversity of the United States: it is an emblem of the shift from the expatriate 1920s to the American 1930s, a shift that the journal will trace. Interestingly, when foreign writers (the English Mary Butts, the French Georges Hugnet) or artists (the French Eugène Atget) are included, their work is mediated by a specific American sponsor: Butts by Ezra Pound, Hugnet by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson, Atget by Berenice Abbott. (10)The first issue of Pagany, for example, contains Mary Butts's short story "The House Party," which gives the Jamesian initiation-into-Europe motif a sardonic twist. The hero Paul is an American "joy-boy," "a cracked little specimen of a gigolo, after a year in prison for something he had not done," who is invited by a worldly Englishman named Vincent to a house party in a "sea-washed, fly-blown, scorched hotel along the coast":

        Under Vincent's wing, a man could stand up a bit. Vincent was English, tender, serious, older than he was. Vincent wanted him to come. Was no doubt cajoling, hypnotizing certain objections. Objections that were always made about him, especially by his own countrymen, the Americans who made a cult of Europe, a cult and a career, not quite perfect in their transplanting and conscious of it."

    Like the Zukofsky whom Williams criticized for "forcing abstract conceptions into the sound pattern," Butts produces a prose notable for its calculated imprecision, its verbal and syntactic oddities. "Under Vincent's wing, a man could stand up a bit": the sentence begins with a familiar cliché, only to deflate it with an absurd description: how does one stand up under someone's "wing"? Then, too, "a man could stand up a bit" alludes to Ford Madox Ford's 1926 A Man Could Stand Up (the third volume of the Parade's End tetralogy), a novel Butts surely knew. Is she saying that Paul's is, in its own way, a life in the trenches not wholly unlike that of Christopher Tietjens? It is hard to tell, Butts's mode being pastiche in Fredric Jameson's sense of "blank parody," parody "devoid . . . of any conviction that alongside the abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some healthy linguistic normality still exists." (11) Vincent, we read further was "no doubt cajoling, hypnotizing certain objections." Again the shift from a Victorian construction ("no doubt cajoling"), to the odd application of hypnosis to, not persons, but abstract nouns referring to mental states. In a similar vein, the energy of the European hosts is said to be "virgin" and Paul's "adventures" are characterized not by their kind but by their "directions." The simile "his adventures out-numbered theirs as the stars the dim electric light bulbs of the hotel" calls attention to the willed extravagance of Butts's style, her refusal of structural coherence in favor of disjunction and dislocation. As she puts it in the opening of "Brightness Falls," "There is no head or tail to this story, except that it happened. On the other hand, how does one know that anything happened? How does one know?" (12) Or take the opening of "The Warning": "This happened in the kind of house people live in who used not to live in that kind of house, who were taught to have very distinct opinions about the kind of people who lived in them. Yet, now that they have gone to live in them, they are rather different than when the other sort of person lived there" (MB 117).

    The similarity to Stein should not be surprising; Butts knew Stein through her close friend Virgil Thomson and had frequented Stein's Paris salon. The first issue of Pagany, for that matter, contains Stein's "Five Words in a Line" (later incorporated into Stanzas in Meditation,1932), which begins:

        Five words in a line.

        Bay and pay make a lake.

        Have to be held with what.

        They have to be held with what they have to be held.

        Dependent of dependent of why.

        With a little cry. (13)

    In his essay "The Work of Gertrude Stein," which follows "Five Words in a Line," Williams remarks, "Having taken the words to her choice . . . [Stein] has completely unlinked them from their former relationships in the sentence. . . . The words, in writing, she discloses, transcend everything" (PI, 1: 43-44). Most poets, Williams reminds the reader, take the easy way out: "Starting from scratch we get, possibly, thatch; just as they have always done in poetry. Then they would try to connect it up by something like -- The mice scratch, beneath the thatch. Miss Stein does away with all that. The free-versists on the contrary used nothing else. They saved -- The mice, under the . . . , (PI, 1: 42).

    Reading Williams's essay, as one normally does, in A Novelette and Other Prose (1931) or, together with his "A 1 Pound Stein" (1934), in the Selected Essays, (14) one assumes that Stein's was a case wholly exceptional, that no one else at the time was so thoroughly "unlinking" words from their normal syntactic relationships. But reading Williams's essay in the context of Pagany suggests that Stein's "unlinkings," like the syntactic oddities, abstractions, and ungainly compoundings (e.g., "orbit-trembling") of Zukofsky, which Williams had called into question, were not all that exceptional in the writing of the early 1930s. Indeed, Stein's free adaptation of Georges Hugnet's surrealist poetic suite Enfances, which appeared in the January-March1931 issue of Pagany, provides an interesting index to the new poetics.

    Between the Cracks

    Stein's thirty-eight page text, which prints Hugnet's French poem and Stein's English version on facing pages, has a complicated history that needn't preoccupy us here; (15) suffice it to say that, according to the original plan, Enfances, together with Stein's "reflection," as she called her version, was to be published in Paris by Editions Jeanne Bucher, with illustrations by Picasso, Louis Marcoussis, and Pavel Tchelitcheff. But when Hugnet objected that Stein's version could not considered a translation of his poem, she responded by giving the text printed in Pagany the title "Poem Pritten on Pfances of Georges Hugnet." (16) When she brought out the book version later that year, Stein eliminated the French text altogether and called her own poem Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship Faded.

    Stein's "free translation" of Hugnet's Enfance has been roundly criticized. Richard Bridgman says it "suffers badly in the presence of the original which it purports to reflect. . . . Stein's liberties were so extreme that, did they not emanate from her, one might reasonably conclude that the translator knew too little French to do the job properly. . . . she carefully censored Hugnet's images of death, sex, nudity, and onanism. For a woman who offered lines of fearsomely coy sexual innuendo, Gertrude Stein remained, even in her middle fifties, prudish, or at least evasive." And even Marianne DeKoven, who celebrates Stein's experimental writing, remarks, "Unfortunately, she seems to equate the essence of poetry with the way many poems sound, and instead of illuminating abstraction she achieves only travesty. . . . Much of the painfully unassimilated 'poetic' diction in Stein's poem is the trace of the French original." (17)

    Note how similar this charge against Stein is to Williams's complaint about Zukofsky's "stilted poetic" language and his "forcing of abstract conceptions into the sound pattern." It is a modernist-based critique of a new way of writing that came to be known by the curiously inappropriate label "Objectivist." Consider #12 of Hugnet's Enfances:

        Ma faim est large, mon appétit démesuré.

        Je peux parler longtemps sans médire

        mais tout me blesse et je sais haïr,

        Ce pays que je vois pour la première fois

        à ma timidité confie les soins du voyage,

        tout ce qu'une absence crée d'incertitude,

        tout ce que la surprise a gagné sur l'amour,

        et c'est si haut que je pense à mon orgueil

        qu'aucun regret de mes humiliations subies pour toi

        n'éxerce mon enfance à redouter la nuit,

        la nuit et ces dons que tu m'as faits,

        ces dons où se tatoua ton indifférence

        sous la forme et le chant d'un regard particulier.

        Enfance, je te nomme au centre du monde,

        au centre de mon coeur tu te nommes toi-même,

        tu te nommes la course à l'exemple de ma faim,

        enfance homicide à l'exemple de ma faim. (PII, 1: 21-22)


        My hunger is great, my appetite without bounds.

        I can speak for a long time without voicing slander

        but everything hurts me and I know how to hate,

        This country which I see for the first time

        entrusts to my timidity the preparations for the trip,

        all that an absence can produce from uncertainty

        all that surprise can do to replace love,

        and it is so great that I think of my pride

        that no regret for the humiliations suffered for you

        can make my childhood fear the night,

        the night and these gifts you have bestowed on me,

        these gifts on which your indifference is tattooed

        beneath the shape and the song of a particular look.

        Childhood, I place you at the center of the world,

        to the center of my heart, you place yourself

        you choose the path commensurate with my hunger,

        homicidal childhood commensurate with my hunger.

    Hugnet's seventeen-line lyric celebrates, in rather melodramatic and strained terms, the secret pleasures of childhood masturbation. Its formal alexandrines, occasionally rhyming, give the poem a Baudelairean cast, even as its theme recalls the self-absorption of Hugnet's friend Jean Cocteau. Stein's "reflection" on Hugnet's "love" poem is wonderfully droll:

        I am very hungry when I drink,
        I need to leave it when I have it held.
        They will be white with which they know they see, that darker
        makes it be a color white for me, white is not shown when I am dark indeed with red despair who comes who has to care that they will let me a little lie like now I like to lie I like to live I like to die I like to lie and live and die and live and die and by and by I like to live and die and by and by the need to sew, the difference is that sewing makes it bleed and such with them in all the way of seed and seeding and repine and they will which is mine and not all mine who can be thought curious of this of all of that made it and come lead it and done weigh it and mourn and sit upon it know it for ripeness without deserting all of it of which without which it has been not been born. Oh no not to be thirsty with the thirst of hunger not alone to know that they plainly and ate or wishes. Any little one will kill himself for milk. (PII, 1: 21-22)

    Contrary to Bridgman's supposition, Stein has obviously read her Hugnet carefully. Indeed, her witty pastiche of his masturbatory lyric takes all his references into account: extreme hunger and despair, the thirst for life punctuated by fear of death, the fidelity to one's ideals and refusal to betray them, the contrast between a virginal white and the red of penetration, the infantile regression to the nursing state. Then, too, Stein makes as much as Hugnet does of repetition and one-ups him at rhyming:

        "They will be white with which they know they see, / that darker makes it be a color white for me," "when I am dark indeed with red despair /who comes who has to care," and so on. But Stein goes much further: her own poem modulates a complex series of monosyllables containing long and short i's ("I like to lie I like to live I like to die I like to lie and live and die and live and die and by and by."), creating a singsong nursery-rhyme rhythm that expresses "enfance" via sound rather than imagery. In this playful network, every phoneme counts: "lie" becomes "live" with the addition of one consonant, and the "it" of line 2 ("I need to leave it when I have it held") changes meaning with every new phrase. Finally, the hyperbole of "thirsty with the thirst of hunger" playfully acknowledges Hugnet's "à l'exemple de ma faim," even as parts of speech are unlinked from their normal position ("not alone to know that they plainly and ate or wishes"). And the poem concludes on a commonsense note that truly does characterize infancy: "Any little one will kill himself for milk."

    One might object at this point that, whatever Stein's relation to Hugnet and his poetic sequence, her version of #12 should be understood as a characteristic Stein work, one text among many similar ones like Tender Buttons or A Long Gay Book, both written almost two decades earlier. But however familiar the repetition, the reduced vocabulary, and skewed grammar, the Stein of the 1910s and early 1920s was not as given to parody and allusive literary play as is the author of "Poem Pritten on Pfances of Georges Hugnet." The early portraits like "Picasso" and "Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia" manifest a care for consistency that we don't find here or in the great poem of this period, "Stanzas in Meditation." Abstraction, intertextuality, the dispersal of the subject, obsessive rhyming and related sound patterning -- these become Stein's signature. Blood, in her scheme of things, is associated, not with Hugnet's wound of love but with what are obliquely presented as her preferred domestic activities. Sewing ("the difference is that sewing makes it bleed") modulates slyly via the rhyme "bleed" / "seed" into the onanism Bridgman takes Stein to have ignored. "All the way to seed and seeding and repine and they will which is mine and not at all mine": these words constitute Stein's covert tribute to Alice Toklas and her witty exposure of Georges Hugnet's vaunted self-absorption. "Know it for ripeness," as she archly puts it, "without deserting all of it."

    From the vantage point of high modernism, such writing was bound to appear deficient: no "direct treatment of the thing," no objective correlative, no clear visual images. Stein's "deliberate gracelessness" --the phrase is Peter Quartermain's with reference to Mina Loy (18) -- may also be linked to the new transgression of conventional gender roles, a transgression that goes hand in hand with the social uncertainties of the early Depression years. The July-September 1931 issue of Pagany, for example, contains Loy's "Lady Laura in Bohemia," which begins:

        Trained in a circus of swans

        she

        proceeds recedingly

        Her eliminate flesh of fashion

        inseparable from the genealogical tree


        columns such towering reticence

        of lifted chin

        her hiccoughs seem

        preparatory to bowing to the Queen

        Her somersault descent

        into the half-baked underworld

        nor the inebriate regret

        disturb her vertical caste

        "They drove 'em from the cradle on the curb" (P2, 3: 125-26)

    "Lady Laura in Bohemia" is perhaps best understood as a late modernist sendup of Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," of Pound's "Portrait d'une Femme," and section12 of Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ("The Lady Valentine"). The swans of Loy's poem are no longer Yeats's "brilliant creatures," drifting mysteriously on Coole lake but a "circus" of debutantes, "trained" to behave according to the norms of their "genealogical tree." "Trained," the opening word in the poem, places emphasis on social and cultural control, an emphasis underscored by the poem's rhythm, which is much closer to the "sequence of metronome" than to that of the "musical phrase" Pound advocated so strenuously. Take the lines:

        she

        proceeds recedingly

        Her eliminate flesh of fashion

        inseparable from the genealogical tree

    Here the rhymes "she" / "recedingly" / "tree" are intentionally silly, forcing the reader to stress the last syllable of "recedingly" and run "genealogical" and "tree" together. More important, Loy's structures of modification are characterized by repeated grammatical oddities: Laura "proceeds recedingly," her "flesh" is "eliminate" (rather than "eliminated") and it "columns" a "towering reticence / of lifted chin." In line 12, the abstract noun "regret" is described as "inebriate" or drunk. In line 13, "caste," Lady Laura's "caste" is defined as "vertical," and the quotation in line 14 is not attributed to anyone in particular. It could be Lady Laura's exclamation, but then again it could be that of a bystander in the "Bohemian" night club or even the words of the poet herself.

    Once one accustoms oneself to the curious coupling of abstract and concrete words in Loy's poetry, her language begins to resonate. The opening describes the entrance of a well-brought up and aristocratic young woman ("Trained in a circus of swans") into a Montparnasse bar (a later couplet reads "her hell is / Zelli's," p. 126) -- an entrance made "recedingly," with mock unobtrusiveness and tiny, graceful steps. In keeping with the fashion and her "genealogical tree," her flesh is "eliminate"--she is properly sleek and slim. But she carries herself so upright that her "lifted chin" and demure demeanor give her an air of "towering reticence" as she "columns" her way into the room. Drunk though she may be, her hiccoughs are beautifully disguised as little bows: she might be curtseying to the queen. Her "descent / into the half-baked underworld" of Bohemia is not so much a fall as a "somersault," which is to say that women of Laura's "vertical caste" always bounce back, no matter how great their "inebriate regret." Her behavior, in other words, is dictated by birth and caste, in sharp contrast to those whose "cradle" has been the "curb."

    What Loy has produced, then, is a sardonic cartoon of café society, the poetic equivalent of a George Grosz cabaret scene. Yet it is composed of the most minimal strokes; no visual picture of the characters or the setting ever fully emerges. People are defined by synecdoches: Laura is the eliminate flesh of fashion, the column of towering reticence, and so on. And when metaphor is used, it is invariably sardonic, as in the final line of the poem, "She is yet like a diamond on a heap of broken glass" (p. 126). There is nothing diamond-like about this "memorable divorcée," who was "christened by the archbishop of Canterbury." Only in a "heap of broken glass" can she sparkle momentarily. And even this reference has a double-entendre, Loy no doubt alluding playfully to the "heap of broken images" in The Waste Land. Eliot parodies, for that matter, were common in this period: in the same volume of Pagany, Mary Butts has a poem called "Thinking of Saints and of Petronius Arbiter" (the title comes directly from Yeats's elegy for Mabel Beardsley, "Upon a Dying Lady") that contains this parody of "The Hollow Men":

        Between the cocktail and the crucifix

        Between the prayer and the fear

        Lies the sword.

        Between the toy and the cigarette

        Between the spite and the joke

        Lies the imagination.... (PII, 2: 89) (19)

    Logopoeia: brittle, hard-edged, tough-minded, slightly nasty. For both Loy and Butts, extravagant verbal play is more important than the Poundian demand for accuracy and precision. But what is especially odd is that even the so-called realistic fiction, most of it by men, found in the pages of Pagany -- a fiction I now turn to -- displays a taste for the grotesquerie and self-parody we find in the work of Stein, Loy, and Butts.


    From Imagism to Super-Realism

    The January-March1931 issue of Pagany, for example, opens with a short story, more properly a prose poem, bearing the portentous title "Hours Before Eternity." It has fifty-three short sections, each assigned a roman numeral. Here are the first two:

        I

        In the chill frost of winter I left Memphis and rode on the outside of freight cars all the way to the Atlantic. The nights were so cold that my fingers froze around the iron bars and at daybreak each morning I had to bite them away with my teeth. The joints of my fingers broke sometimes when I bit them from the iron and the flesh cracked to the bone like the deep cut of a sharp knife. When I got to Charleston I worked all night in a dairy and drank the warm foam of the new white milk and all day I sat in my room at the boarding house and waited for the coming of the first blossoms of the magnolia trees.

        II

        Men who worked with their hands and backs were proud of their male strength when they ran shouting in naked strides to their women but those with soft damp fingers were so ashamed of themselves that they whispered in halting negatives and tried to cover their vulgarity with towels. (P2, 1: 1)

    Realistic autobiographical narrative in the vein of Sherwood Anderson or Ring Lardner? A naturalistic picture of the seamy side of life in the poverty-stricken rural South? It begins that way, with the references to Memphis and Charleston, the hopping of freight trains and fingers frozen to the iron window bars. But the second section, with its distinction between the "Men who worked with their hands and backs," (note the erotic double entendre in the apparently blunt statement) and "those with soft damp fingers" seems oddly gratuitous in the context. The strong and the weak? The studs and the pansies? What, one wonders, does this seemingly homophobic dismissal have to do with the narrator's quest, which leads him to pursue "the quick beauty of of a girl's face" seen in a crowd and stunning enough to be blinding. "As soon as I could see again I looked and saw a scar on my eyes. The scar was an etching of the beauty I had seen and when tears had tried but could not wash its lines away I saw it framed in colors like the rainbow"? (II, 1: 2).

    The image of the scar across the eyes has a surrealistic cast (one thinks of Max Ernst's 1929 La femme 100 têtes) at odds with the hard-boiled narrative of passages like "I walked into the country again and worked among negroes on a farm. The white man made us sweat from sun-up till dark and he would not let us stop for a drink of water" (XII). A similar equivocation between surrealism and naturalism occurs later:

        XV

        The negro girl that he told me to bring him would not come to his house and I went back and told him so. He told me to harness a mule and follow him. We went down to the cabin where the girl was and he brought her outside and dropped her in the yard. While he put a trace chain around her waist I backed the mule and hooked the chain to the single-tree. When we were ready to go he kicked the mule in the belly and broke off a hunk of chewing tobacco. The negro girl was dragged behind the mule to the house and when we got there I helped him take her inside. He forged the chain around her and spiked it to the floor. When I went to sleep I could hear the rattling of the chain and when I woke up it was rattling again. The girl cried all the time but he would not let her go home.

        XVI

        Once that winter one of the negroes said he was too sick to work so we killed him with a shotgun and buried him in the manure pile.

        XVII

        The man brought another negro girl to the house but she had greased her body with lard and when he took off her clothes he could not hold her. (II, 1: 3)

    Such writing has usually been classified as the "literature of social protest," with the horrific narrative providing, in flat, objective manner, a graphic image of white oppression and black victimization. Short declarative sentences, reductive vocabulary, lack of involvement of the speaking subject: these are what one might expect from the author of "Hours Before Eternity" who happens to be Erskine Caldwell, the best-selling Southern "naturalist" author of Tobacco Road (1932) and God's Little Acre (1933), the young Communist who went on to visit Russia with his then-wife Margaret Bourke-White and wrote the text for her book of documentary photographs You have Seen Their Faces (1937), later becoming increasingly conservative, a "sell-out" to Hollywood, relegated today to the company of forgotten white male writers of the period. Even James E. Devlin, who wrote the 1984 Twayne book on Caldwell, concludes:

        He is without any question a minor writer, and further, a limited one. Philosophically he is of few ideas and those often inconsistent. He has never decided whether it is the heart or the head to which he owes the greater allegiance. His belief in feeling, intuition, and emotion as God-directed often falters when opposed by the strong pressure of a naturalistic determinism that also guides his thought. About sexual passion he is simultaneously knowedgeable and as innocent as Steve Henderson, the wooden sixteen-year-old of Summertime Island (1968). (20)

    What, then, is this "minor" "naturalist" writer doing in Pagany, alongside Pound, Williams, Butts, Stein, Loy, and Zukofsky, alongside the photographs of Eugène Atget and Berenice Abbott, the Charles Demuth illustrations for Henry James's Turn of the Screw? Is it just one of those mistaken links that hindsight can correct? (21) Or can we read the much castigated stylistic inconsistecies somewhat differently?

    In a 1935 essay for The New Republic, reprinted in The Philosophy of Literary Form, Kenneth Burke singles out for comment Caldwell's "Hours Before Eternity," and the two related stories that comprise "The Sacrilege of Alan Kent," published in the collection American Earth. (1931).

        They contain a kind of aphoristic rhetoric, except that the aphorisms are less ideas than tiny plots. . . . The swift segments shunt us back and forth between brutality and wistfulness. Perhaps the grandiose, the violent, and the gentle qualities of the piece are all fused in this bit of purest poetry: "Once the sun was so hot a bird came down and walked beside me in my shadow." A section in Pagany containing this item was the first thing by Caldwell I ever saw. For days I was noisy in my enthusiasm--but I could not understand how it went with some of his other work. (22)

    In trying to understand his own reaction, Burke suggests that Caldwell's "cult of incongruity" (KB 352) results from a "balked religiosity," channelled into "political exhortation," the resulting perspective being not so much complex in the modernist sense, as wilfully contradictory. His "particular aptitude has been in scrambling or garbling properties," a "deft way of putting the wrong things together" (KB 351-52). For Devlin, such inconsistency is ipso facto a fault, but for Burke, proto-postmodernist that he is, irresolution has a positive side. What he likes about "Hours Before Eternity," is that the text "muddl[es] our judgments instead of stabilizing them" (KB 353). Such withholding on the author's part, he posits, "is the subtlest feature of Caldwell's method. Where the author leaves out so much, the reader begins making up the difference for himself. Precisely by omitting humaneness where humaneness is most called for, he may stimulate the reader to supply it" (KB, 355). And he concludes, "I have denied that Caldwell is a realist. In his tomfoolery he comes closer to the Dadaists; when his grotesqueness is serious, he is a Superrealist," a poet of "nonrational linkages" and "fantastic simplifications" (KB, 356-57).

    "Fantastic simplification" is a good term, not only for Caldwell's fiction but also for much of the work published in Pagany and in such related journals as Blues and Contact. "Dada" and "Superrealist" (surrealist) may not be quite the defining terms for "Hours Before Eternity," for the dadaists would never have produced sentences so sober and realistic as "He handed me a cup of flour and a piece of fat meat and a few potatoes and gave me permission to use his cooking stove" (PII, 1: 3), and the surrealists were much more programmatic and Freudian. Rather, Caldwell's "deft way of putting the wrong things together" depends upon a curious undercutting of the authority of the subject. The tone is so uncertain, shifting as it does from caricature to pathos, from a racy humor to a grim earnestness, that, in Burke's words, "it muddl[es] our judgments rather than stabilizing them." In a paragraph like section XV above, for example, the curious and confusing use of personal pronouns (thirty-one in nine sentences) distances the reader from the terrible events, "him" and "her" becoming, in one sense, so many counters on a chessboard.

    Such distancing "superrealism" would seem to be a homegrown product, quite appropriate for the pages of a "Native Quarterly." Indeed, the "non-rational linkages" and "fantastic abstractions" Burke speaks of, the predilection for parody, play, contradiction, and the undercutting of mimesis despite referential overload, can be seen as a kind of signature of literary discourse in Depression America. Take Edward Dahlberg's autobiographical narrative "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days," which immediately follows Gertrude Stein's "Poem Pritten on Pfances" in the January-March1931 issue of Pagany.

    Like Erskine Caldwell, Edward Dahlberg is now a largely forgotten writer; his name is not even listed in the 1988 Columbia Literary History of the United States. If he is remembered at all, it is largely for the role he played as mentor to the young Charles Olson. (23) But again like Caldwell, when read against texts by Stein and Williams in the pages of Pagany, Dahlberg emerges as by no means just another documentary realist with socialist convictions. "And yet it all came back, the taste of it, the tang and brine of it, like the windy crispy newspaper afternoon air over the san francisco wharves," the Pagany story begins, conventionally enough, its focus on the recording, remembering "I," detached from the "tastes" and "tang" of his childhood. But detachment gives way to penny-arcade jingles, whose rhythms recall Stein's Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded:

        call me up some rainy afternoon

        and we'll have a quiet little spoon

        and we'll talk about the weather

        i'll see that my mother takes a walk

            mum's the word, baby dear (PII, 1: 39)

    And these Tinpan Alley tunes are juxtaposed with manic catalogues in which image is piled on image to create a space at once "real" and yet wholly fantastic in its contours:

        dago bread, cheney watermelon hucksters, lyric moving picture house, open air tents, lawdie lawdie tabernacle sermons, halley's comet, the end of the world, bad rodent dreams in the 8th street flat, bohunk nightmares, blackhand barky trees, pimpish gaslight joints, the midnight ride of a can of beer, ach du lieber augustin

        the kansas city west bottoms, a wiry and rusty rat trap, the bluffs stale, gone-looking boxcar smoke in the back of his throat, red caboose bonfires, corn-stalk smoking, m.k.t., chicago & alton blakean alfalfa field midnights, casy jones got another papa, roundhouse cindery toe-stubbing noons, adobe main street 11 o'clock mornings, armour & swift packinghouse summers, dusty hoofbeaten heifer clouds. . . . hoss swopping piddling saturdays, pony boy, pony boy, won't you be my tony boy. . . . (39-40)

    Such cataloguing is closer to Ginsberg than to Whitman, evident if we lineate Dahlberg's passage using as model the strophes of "Howl!" or "America": :

        gone-looking boxcar smoke in the back of his throat, red caboose bonfires, corn-stalk smoking, m. k. t., chicago & alton blakean alfalfa field midnights, casy jones got another papa, roundhouse cindery toe-stubbing noons. . . .

    As later in "Howl," such passages are melopoeic rather than phanopoeic, with the clustering, heavy stresses, marked marked alliteration and assonance producing a heightened, surreal rhythm, as in:

        alton blakean alfalfa field midnights

    where "blakean" is a self-conscious intervention into the otherwise mimetic base, as is the subsequent interjection of the song lyric "casy jones got another papa." Williamsian images like "a wiry and rusty rat trap," and "red caboose bonfires" alternate with documentary reference ("armour & swift packing house") and surreal phrasing ("the midnight ride of a can of beer"). The text never quite makes up its mind where it wants to go, but this may be precisely its appeal, the very language calling into question the forward linear movement we expect of narrative.

    Is the publication in Pagany of Dahlberg's prose an anomaly? I think that on the contrary this text, like Caldwell's "Hours before Eternity," provides a matrix for Zukofsky's early "Objectivist" poetry that may well be more telling than the usual placement of that poetry in the Pound-Williams tradition. Take, for example, Zukofsky's "Four Poems" ("Buoy," "Awake," "Blue light is the night harbor-slip," and "Passing tall"), published alongside Dahlberg's "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days," Stein's "Poem Pritten on Pfances," and Butts's "Thinking of Saints." With the exception of "Awake," these poems, written between 1925 and 1931, were included in "29 Poems." (24) Here is "Buoy":

        Buoy -- no, how

        It is not a question: what

        Is this freighter carrying? --

        Did smoke blow? -- That whistle? --

        Of course, commerce will not complete

        Anything, yet the harbor traffic is busy,

        there shall be a complete fragment

        Of--

        Nothing, look! that gull

        Streak the water!

        Getting nearer are we,

        Hear? count the dissonances,

        Shoal? accost-cost

        Cost accounting." (CSP 23-24)

    Williams was surely right in telling Zukofsky that his early poems had not early poems have not been "objectivized in new or fresh observations." Zukofsky's break with what Burton Hatlen has called a "late Imagist" "poetics of presence," a poetics in which "words remain absolutely faithful to 'things' in their sensory immediacy," is incontrovertible, but I am not sure it follows that "if the seeable is by definition unsayable, then language, rather than giving us Being in its fullness, must reconcile itself to the more difficult task of enacting our endless and endlessly frustrated struggle toward Being." (25) For like the Stein of "Poems Pritten on Pfances" or the Loy of "Lady Laura of Bohemia," the Zukofsky of "Buoy" foregrounds the play of the signifier, especially paragram and pun. "Buoy -- no, how": the first line puns on "Boy -- know how," "know how" being the great trait in thirties technological America. "Boy, what know how!": like George Oppen's frigidaire poem ("Thus / Hides the /Parts. . ."), published in the "Objectivist" number of Poetry (January 1931), Zukofsky is examining a world in which coherent natural images -- a buoy at sea as a point de repère for incoming freighters -- have been replaced by floating signifiers. "It is not a question" (line 2) of asking what "this freighter [is] carrying," or even where the smoke is coming from or who blew the whistle. Since "commerce will not complete / Anything," there are no meaningful images, only a "complete fragment" --but "Of" what? Evidently "Of--/ Nothing."

    The second stanza urges us to "look" at "that gull / Streak the water!" But this is not the world of Hart Crane's "Bridge," composed in these same years, where the "seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him, / Over the chained bay water Liberty." No "apparitional" white gulls as emblems of transcendence. "Getting nearer are we," asks the poet. "Hear?" (again with a pun on "here"). And then, in what is a statement of poetics, we read, "count the dissonances." And dissonances are what we live with. The following question "Shoal?"suggests that there is no coherent picture to be composed of this harbor scene, no line of demarcation between shore or shoal and water can be shown. Images "accost" us, but "accost" contains within it the word "cost," and this in turn suggests the "Cost accounting" of the final line. "Commerce" is what it's really all about; money is the "buoy or marker around which the "busy" harbor traffic revolves. But -- and I think this is important--the poem is not at all polemical about this state of affairs; its focus is on the ironic potential of words to "mean" differently when they are "unlinked" from their usual contexts. No pretty harbor scene with freighters in the distance sailing between the buoys. "Count--cost-accost-account": the cost of accounting, the accosting (accounting) of costs: the play is Steinian in its wit.

    Then, too, the lineation of "Buoy" obliquely pokes fun at the imagist free-verse lyric. Much has been made of Zukofsky's musical virtuosity, (26) but it is useful to remember that his soundscapes exist at the micro-- rather than the macro level of lyric form, a poem like "Buoy" modulating long o's ("no," "smoke," "blow") and iy diphthongs ("Streak," "nearer," "we," "hear") with great ingenuity, even as its individual lines are purposely flat-footed. "Buoy--no, how": three stresses on monosyllables, separated by punctuation: hardly an attractive line. The next two are similar:

        It is nót a quéstion: // whát

        Is this fréighter cárryíng?--

    To call these lines "prosaic" would still not convey the oppositional, anti-poetic stance of the young Zukofsky, his aggressive challenge to the reader to "count the dissonances." Surely "Objectivist," with its connotations of materiality, is a curious label for a lyric so uncompromising and so self-destructive.


    AMERICA FIRST AND LAST

    I have been arguing that the poetics of the early 1930s produced an adversarial literature that called into question the pieties of an earlier, more innocent modernism by means of powerful wit, complex parody, contradiction of formal and emotional registers, and especially the dissolution of the coherent "lyric voice" as controlling presence in the poetic text. The sentimental slides into the cynical and back again. Reference, moreover, does not insure mimetic representation. Nothing is taken for granted; nothing is quite what it seems to be.

    This can be seen even in the photographs of the period. In the January-March1931 issue of Pagany, we find, side by side with Dahlberg's fiction and Zukofsky's poetry, four reproductions of Eugène Atget photographs, evidently transmitted to the editor by Berenice Abbott, of whom more in a moment. Atget's astonishing images of shop windows, arcades, doorways, and street corners, most of them curiously empty of people, are at once documentary and surrealistic, their lighting and angle shots endowing the most ordinary scenes -- a dressmaker's dummy in a shop window, a display of stuffed animals, a puppet-theatre curtain, or monkey house in the park -- with a dreamlike presence, rather as Zukofsky's "buoy" or Williams's "back wings of the hospital" become part of a language game. Furthermore, the fabled breakdown of the divide between "high" and "low" art attributed to postmodernism is taken for granted in these prints, where the mundane is inseparable from the emphasis on formal composition.

    Thousands of the negatives Atget had made prior to his death in 1927, at a time when his work was virtually unknown, were rescued and printed by Berenice Abbott, four of whose own photographs appear in the next issue of Pagany. Having returned to America as part of the expatriate exodus from Paris in 1929, Abbott wanted to do for New York what Atget had done for Paris. In particular, she wanted to provide a documentary record of urban transformation: the demolition of old buildings to make way for the new skyscrapers, the surviving neighborhood shops, the relation of technology to nature, stone and steel to sky. Like Atget's, her images are only superficially instances of documentary realism, their strange placement and surprising juxtapositions of materials creating a landscape as surreal as Caldwell's mysterious Southern sites.

    The 1931 volume, which featured these photographs as well as Charles Demuth's similarly stylized watercolor illustrations for Henry James's The Turn of the Screw, side-by-side with the poetry of Williams and the fiction of Dahlberg and Dos Passos, was thus a triumph for Pagany. But the following year, things began to unravel. True, Richard Johns was still discovering new (or new for him) authors: the January-March1932 issue had a long poem ("Brown River, Smile") by Jean Toomer, whose Cane Johns had long admired, as well as a first appearance ("Electra-Orestes") by H. D. But the journal's financial situation had become precarious. (27) Often, Johns couldn't afford to pay his authors, much less the print shop, and the quality of production went down. To make things worse, a number of accidents (including a fire) caused manuscripts to be destroyed. The October-December 1932 issue was thus delayed and didn't come out until February 1933. And this was Pagany's final issue.

    The usual explanation for such endings is that the modernist avant-garde could not survive the Depression, that it gave way to a more socially conscious, more politicized "writing on the Left," as it came to be called. In his moving Introduction to Stephen Halpert's Return to PAGANY (1969), for example, Kenneth Rexroth, whose own poetry was featured in the pages of Zukofsky's"Objectivists" Anthology and Charles Henri Ford's Blues, as well as in the first issue of Pagany, put it this way:

        Pagany's lifetime spanned the breakdown of the international avant garde as the world economic crisis shut down and a quite different kind of literature emerged. . . . Under the pressure of catastrophe, writers and artists all over the world began to turn to attack the specific social evils from which they had thought they had escaped by concentrating on the underlying, fundamental Lie. Richard Johns was especially sensitive to this great turn, and published some of the earliest and finest writing of the kind that was eventually to be debauched and destroyed by the slogans of falsification--Proletcult and Socialist Realism. (ARP xiii, xv).

    But this is not quite the way it happened. For one thing, the poetry of the Objectivists, as of Mina Loy and Mary Butts, and of the Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams of the 1930s, was already quite different in mood and rhetoric from the more utopian work of the early modernists. Picasso's Ma Jolie (1913), for example, was, for all its cubist fragmentation and complexity, still a highly painterly work, a portrait, after all, of a lady, whereas it isn't clear that Abbott's "documentary" studies of barbershop storefronts, sandwiched between newer steel and concrete structures, are "art" at all. A similar contrast can be found between Ulysses and Dos Passos's U.S.A., whose "Eveline" sequence appeared in the summer and autumn 1931 issues of Pagany.

    Secondly, the umbrella term "social protest literature" obscures some important distinctions. Like Rexroth himself, the Objectivist poets were certainly "writers on the Left" (George Oppen is perhaps the most striking example of the poet who, as onetime Communist party member, had to go underground during the McCarthy years), but the Left was itself curiously divided when it came to questions of aesthetic. Consider the July-September 1932 issue of Pagany, which features the "First Movement" (to become book I) of Zukofsky's monumental poem "A". The well-known opening, which provides us with the title of the poem, its first word, and the note musicians tune by, all the while using the separation of the indefinite article ("A") from the noun ("round") it modifies to create a pun on the preposition "around," immediately calls into question the authority of the lyric speaker:

    	A
       	   Round of fiddles playing Bach --
    	    The double chorus.
    		  "Come ye daughters, share my anguish --"
    	     Bare arms, black dresses
    		 "See Him!  Whom?--"
    	      Bediamond the passion of our Lord
    		 "See Him!  How?--"	 		 (PIII, 3: 9)  


    The scene (we learn further along) is Carnegie Hall, the occasion an Easter Sunday performance of Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, with phrases from the oratorio punctuating the narrator's account. And even these phrases, become the subject of the poet's play, with "See Him! Whom?, "See Him! How?" referring to the audience's alienation from the Christian ethos of the Passion. "First Movement" now submits these motifs to a complex "musical" development, that partly echoes, partly ironizes Bach's own music, and it ends with bits of conversation overheard on the street after the concert:

        "We ran 'em in chain gangs, down in the Argentine,

        Executive's not the word, use engineer,

        Single-handed, ran 'em like soldiers,

        Seventy-four yesterday, and could run 'em today. . ." (PIII, 3: 13)

    This voice (evidently of a wealthy industrialist) is punctuated by the words of the Passion ("Ye lightnings, ye thunders / In clouds are ye vanished?"), which in their turn modulate into a concluding line --"Open, O fierce flaming pit!" -- that refers, not only to the oratorio from which it comes, but also to the poet's own sense of hell inherent in the contrast between the musical discourse of Bach and the discourse of the city in which his Passion is heard, or rather goes unheard.

    It is instructive to compare "A" to a poem which appears later in the same issue of Pagany:

        ENTREATY AT DELPHI

        We again have come

        through muted lanes where shadows were aflame

        with lowered voices, and where wings were lame

        and wide limbs dumb;

        we again have seen

        the terror muffled with an earthly tread

        of inner footbeats travelling where led

        into a desert scene

        and we have glanced

        upon the muffled image of the flower

        opening, petal on petal, every hour

        and were entranced

        to a deep sleep

        made up of cast-off visages and days

        recalled, and many unenacted plays

        where actors weep

        and know not why.

        O, must the evening find us still unborn

        unknowing while our foliage is torn

        cruelly from us, here, before we die? (PIII, 3: 88-89)

    Coming upon this after reading Butts and Loy, Stein and Zukofsky, the reader may well be confused. Is this a late poem by Arthur Symons? Ernest Dowson? John Davidson? The voice that speaks in neatly rhyming abba quatrains is in total control, able to speak for a larger "we," a "we" who are somehow (how?) "unborn" and "unknowing," waiting for the miracle at Delphi to occur. Predictably the lanes are "muted," their shadows "aflame," their "terror muffled." Everything is vague, shadowy, disembodied, melancholy. But why and how?

    The author of this poem, Edwin Rolfe, was a Communist activist poet as well as a iction writer-journalist, who appeared frequently in New Masses and The Daily Worker, and was to serve, in 1937, in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and write a volume of poems about the Spanish Civil War. "Rolfe," writes Cary Nelson, "is one of the politically committed poets whose work largely meets New Critical standards for producing formally coherent, metaphorically inventive, fully realized, and self-sufficient poems. That he is almost wholly excluded from our cultural memory demonstrates that political--not merely purportedly disinterested aesthetic--criteria have helped determine what poets we honor in our texts and literary histories." (28)

    But it is not clear what Nelson means by terms like "formally coherent," "self-sufficient," or "aesthetic." In point of fact, Rolfe's latter-day Yellow Nineties mode (29) would certainly not meet "New Critical standards," and not because of the poet's political stance; rather, a critic like Cleanth Brooks or Allen Tate would have complained of the laxity of the poem's diction and the self-indulgence of its tone. Indeed, it is time we stopped pitting the ostensible "radicalism" of poets like Rolfe against "New Critical" "conservatism" and compare it instead to the very different Left radicalism of the Objectivists, whose work was at least as neglected by, say, Brooks and Warren as was Rolfe's.

    The case of James T. Farrell, whose first appearance in Pagany was in the same issue, is similar. Here is the opening of "Twenty-Five Bucks":

        Fifteen years is a hell of a long time to live in grease. Fifteen years is a hell of a long time to keep getting your jaw socked. Fifteen years is a hell of a long time for a broken-down, never-was of a palooka named Kid Tucker. Fifteen years stretched back through a reeking line of stale fight clubs, of jeers and clammy dressing rooms, and lousy gyms, and cheap can houses where every bed sheet is filthy with the countless foot marks of nameless customers, of ratty saloons with sawdust floors. . . . (P3, no. 3: 97)

    "Use no word," Pound had cautioned in a statement Zukofsky, for one, took very seriously, "that does not contribute to the presentation." But in Farrell's tale of the prize-fighter's demise -- the opening paragraph above is a kind of recycling of Eliot's "sawdust restaurants with oyster shells," but without Eliot's irony. Farrell's words, especially his adjectives, are nothing if not predictable: fight-clubs are "stale," dressing-rooms "clammy," gyms "lousy," saloons "ratty," and bed-sheets "filthy." And the passage's heavy repetition (the anaphora of "Fifteen years. . .") does not exactly make for a dynamic rhythm.

    Oddly enough, then, this vein of "proletarian" writing bypassed modernism, returning to the genteel tradition of a previous generation. The split between the aesthetic and the political, a split that had threatened the life of the avant-garde from the time of its inception in the later nineteenth century, had now widened to a large fissure. The "radical political" wing associated with Edwin Rolfe and James Farrell was quickly co-opted by the Establishment. In the winter of 1934, exactly one year after the last issue of Pagany was published, the Partisan Review put out its first issue. Subtitled "A Bi-Monthly of Revolutionary Literature," Partisan Review was the official organ of the John Reed Club of New York (a cell of the American Communist Party) until 1937 when, in response to the Moscow Show Trials, the magazine severed its Party connections. The editorial in the first issue states:

        We propose to concentrate on creative and critical literature, but we shall maintain a definite viewpoint -- that of the revolutionary working class. Through our specific literary medium we shall participate in the struggle of the workers and sincere intellectuals against imperialist war, fascism, national and racial oppresison, and for the abolition of the system which breeds these evils. The defense of the Soviet Union is one of our principal tasks. (Partisan Review 1, no. 1 [Feb.-March 1934]: 2)

    The issue opens with two short short stories about social injustice by Grace Lumpkin, but otherwise, its contributors (all of them white male) resort to the Poetic Diction I described above. Here again are Farrell (an extract from Studs Lonigan) and Rolfe, whose "Poem for May First" is a clarion call urging the comrades to create a brave new world in the image of the new Soviet Union. Here is an excerpt"

            The brain will not deny

            the days that come with verdure nor the eye

            ignore the splendor of the changing year

            invested with surprise: bells clanging in the ear

            with sound that drowns the singing of the birds

            and voices rich with prophecy--the words

            fraught with great deeds. (30) (PR 1, no. 1: 32)

    The language of the people? Or an echo of Longfellow? If, as Henri Meschonnic and Anthony Easthope (both, incidentally, marxist critics) have argued, the choice of meter is itself an ideological choice, (31) then Rolfe's smooth iambic-pentameter couplets have an interesting subtext.

    And indeed by 1937 the Partisan Review had not only dissociated itself from the John Reed Club, but was publishing mainstreammodernist and neo-modernist works: the December 1937 issue featured Delmore Schwartz's "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities," Wallace Stevens's "The Dwarf," an essay by William Troy called "The Symbolism of Zola," and reviews by Lionel Trilling, Arthur Mizener, Sidney Hook, and Philip Rahv. Within a few years, Partisan Review poetry, fiction, and criticism were all but indistiguishable from the poetry, fiction, and criticism of the "conservative" Kenyon Review, founded in 1939. The first issue of the Kenyon, for that matter, included Delmore Schwartz's essay "The Two Audens" and Philip Rahv's "Franz Kafka: The Hero as Lonely Man."

    So began the rapprochement between the Left and its supposed enemy, the New Criticism. Meanwhile, the "other" or "aesthetic" radical wing had a harder time of it. "Poor ol White Mule," wrote Williams sadly to Richard Johns in late 1933, "I wish I could go on with it. Not a word have I written on it since Pagany busted" (ARP 511). Not until1937, when a young publisher named James Laughlin came into the picture, did Williams have the heart to finish his novel, which Laughlin offered to bring out.

    The Objectivists and related Pagany poets had a harder time of it. Never published in mainstream little magazines like Partisan Review, they more or less went underground, not revived until the 1960s and 1970s, when first the Black Mountain / San Francisco poets and then the Language group took them up. At the Poets of the Thirties conference held at the University of Maine in June 1993, there were five sessions on Zukofsky alone and three apiece on Reznikoff, Loy, and Lorine Niedecker, whose Objectivist poetry began to appear shortly after the Pagany period. The keynote poetry reading, moreover, was given before a large and reverential audience, by the now ninety-year-old Carl Rakosi. The poetic of the 1930s, distinct as that poetic is from the modernism that immediately preceded it, seems finally to be getting its due. At the same time -- and perhaps this is why the early 1930s are so fascinating for us-- the split that haunts that American decade similarly haunts our own. The argument for "radical" subject-matter (never mind its mode of production or materiality) is once again being made, this time no longer for writers identified with a particular political party or movement, but for members of "marginalized" ethnic, racial, and gender groups. Now as then, identity politics often goes hand in hand with what turns out to be the most mainstream and conventional of aesthetics-- the minority group, its teeth unfanged, turned commodity on the Bill Moyers Journal and similar TV programs. A real Revolution of the Word, we learn from such publications as the "Objectivists"Anthology or Pagany, cannot be packaged; it inevitably involves the "barbed-wire entanglements" that made Harriet Monroe extremely nervous, even as she had the courage to give them a hearing.

### DIALOGUE ON EVALUATION IN POETRY by Marj

Marjorie Perloff and Robert von Hallberg

For Professions: Conversations on the Future of Literary and Cultural Studies, ed. Donald Hall (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), pp. 87-108.
* * *

Robert von Hallberg: I thought we would pursue our dialogue by assessing various evaluative criteria that are in play now among poet-critics, since they are the writers who most forthrightly make evaluative arguments. Readers find all sorts of reasons to admire a particular poem, poet, or even school of poets, but critics of poetry are often asked to state their standards abstractly, exactly because they traditionally assert on principle that poetry is not just another discourse, but a specially authoritative use of language. I know we can both speak abstractly about particular criteria; probably neither of us has the old aspiration of advocating some universal or even just permanent criterion for assessing poetry. I want to leave open the possibility of invoking different criteria for different poems,and even of invoking different criteria at different moments. You probably want the same latitude, so focusing on particular critical arguments now current makes sense to me.

Marjorie Perloff: Well, no, actually I guess I do still have that "old aspiration." And in a way my definition of poetry is quite conventional and classical. I believe a poem differs from routine or normal discourse (like this statement,for instance) by being the art form that foregrounds language, in its complexity, intensity, and, especially, relatedness. My criterion here is what Aristotle called to prepon or fitness. In the poetic text, everything is related to everything else--or should be--the whole being a construct of sameness and difference in pleasing proportions. What makes something "pleasing" can of course not be said outright and depends on the reader, the historical moment, and the cultural milieu. But we can say what poetry isn't: it is not straightforward, expository discourse (as in a chemistry textbook), whose aim is to convey information. I go back to Wittgenstein’s proposition (#160) in Zettel, "Do not forget that a poem, even though it is composed in the language of information, is not used in the language-game of giving information."

Poetry must meet the criterion of re-readability. If a poem can be absorbed at one reading (as the typical poetry reading demands--i.e., at one hearing), then it's not much of a poem. Poetry is news that stays news; it is "language charged with meaning" (Ezra Pound). And here Pound's aphorisms accord with Russian Formalism and the notion of defamiliarization, making strange, the orientation toward the neighboring word. But neither Pound's nor the Russian Formalist notion is new: one finds the same formula in Sidney's Defense of Poetry or in Johnson's Preface to Shakespeare, where we read "Nothing can please many, and please long, but just representations of general nature." I take Johnson’s "just" to mean the Aristotelian "fitting" (the prepon again), the implication being that representations (whether in lyric, drama, or fiction) must strike us not just as plausible according to some outside norm, but internally consistent and coherent.

"Language charged with meaning" suggests that poetry can never be a matter of "lovely" or "elegant" language but that it must be meaning-ful; on the other hand, "meaning" that is external to or prior to language, as in much of contemporary writing that passes for "poetry" is not poetry either.

RvH: You have surprised me already. When you say that "everything is related to everything else" in the poetic text, I wonder how you experience the reading of Pound's Cantos or Susan Howe's Articulation of Sound Forms in Time. No one sees how all words, phrases, and sentences in these texts are related to all the others there; no poem is all coherence. When the sounds of adjacent syllables or the feel of proximate rhythms lead one to sense a relatedness beyond what can be fully articulated, that is the deep charm of poetry that underwrites the sense that poetry and religion are somehow neighbors--as well as the suspicion that poetry is a game of smoke and mirrors, of illusory relatedness. As critics we tell all about the relatedness we can explicate, and frequently imply that we might tell more, had we world enough and time. But much of the contemporary poetry I love is frankly mysterious to me, which means that I cannot go very far with the coherence criterion.

Coherence, as you describe it, is bound implicitly to a notion of economy: your point is not the simple one that there is much coherence in poetry but that there is no incoherence in poetry. I constantly try to read past incoherence in poetry, but I accept this effort as my lot. You seem to want a poetry that appears to be very highly coherent, which means highly economical. The poets I admire most are those who, on the one hand, condense their work so that its coherence is palpable, stony; Turner Cassity and Philip Larkin might be useful examples because their formality expresses that condensation so boldly, but Louise Glück and her onetime mentor George Oppen can also serve as examples, and they are not metrical poets. Reading these poets, one knows that one cannot account for each word and syntactic turn in terms of relatedness to other words and turns, but one does feel, line by line, that a strenuous process of selection for coherence has pruned the words down to remarkably few. On the other hand are those poets, whom I also admire, like Pound, Olson, and Ashbery who accept the inevitability of incoherence and let economy be damned. For these writers, a principle of coherence is negatively involved; one admires their work despite its moments of apparent incoherence, despite its lack of economy. In fact, incoherence and extravagance are signs that a poem is working at the edges of convention, straining for beauty and meaning that come without coherence. I expected you to speak more for the avant-garde range of the latter, capacious, Whitmanesque approach to poetry. So, as I said, you surprise me.

MP I think we’re talking about two different kinds of "coherence" or "relatedness" here. The Cantos, to take one of your examples, exhibit precisely the re-readability I was talking about. I opened at random to this passage in Canto LXXIV:

    One day were clouds banked on Taishan

    Or in glory of sunset

    And tovarish blessed without aim

    Wept in the rainditch at evening

    Sunt lumina

    That the drama is wholly subjective

    Stone knowing the form which the carver imparts it

    The stone knows the form

    Sia Cythera, sia Ixotta, sia in Santa Maria dei Miracoli

    Where Pietro Romano had fashioned the bases

    OU TIS

    A man on whom the sun has gone down (p. 450)

Here in the first of the Pisan Cantos is a recharging of the sacred images we know from the earlier Cantos: Mount Taishan, the light from the great crystal, Cythera (Venus), Ixotta delgi Atti (Malatesta’s adored mistress), the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, the reference to "OU TIS" (Odysseus in the Cyclops’ cave calling himself "no man"), a "man on whom the sun has gone down" who is obviously the poet himself. The reference to himself as "tovarish" ("comrade"), on the other hand, reminds us of the actual political situation in 1945, a situation tragically at odds with those images of Mount Taishan and Cythera. And the wonderful chiming of "tovarish"/ "rainditch" reenforces that harsh note. And yet another kind of relatedness is that of linguistic registers: we shift from the "glory of sunset" (line 1) to "sunt lumina" (line 5), so that light itself is refracted in complex ways, "sunt lumina," taken from Ovid, having been used earlier in the poem.

So I would say that here everything is "related" with great finesse, both to neighboring words and images and to Cantos written thirty years earlier. True, there are places in the Cantos where Pound rants on and on in his didactic, Douglasite, paranoid, anti-Semitic way, and clearly those parts are not as effective poetically, quite aside from the noxious "ideas" conveyed.

So far I’ve been focusing on universals. But now: if certain basic poetic principles remain intact across time, clearly other features change. Metrical and generic forms, for example, are often historically and culturally generated and conditioned. The Petrarchan sonnet, we know, originated in a particular court culture in fourteenth-century Italy; there are no Roman sonnets. The Pindaric Ode, originally a war poem, and adapted in various ways by Renaissance and Eighteenth-Century poets, no longer plays a significant role in poetry. Yet many critics persist in arguing, as has Helen Vendler, that the poet at any time has the choice of using any verse form he or she likes. What do you think of this argument?

RvH: [Transition needed] Contemporary poetry presents a special case, exactly because contemporaneity is one widely used evaluative criterion. It may be a mistake, as many critics have claimed, to evaluate art in terms of its special purchase on a historical moment. But the pressure to evaluate the art of our own moment in terms of its responsiveness to the immediate energies we recognize is very great. Eliot said that the poetry of our contemporaries has special pleasure for us, and this is what I mean. Contemporary poetry engages with this special moment of community, and this is where the accumulated interpretation of our predecessors is minimal. The burden of the past is negligible, and the future is open. A critic of the present feels that this or that quality in the art is in short supply, a little more of something or other seems the prescription for the art just now.

MP. Now it’s my turn to be surprised. I would have thought you believed that the "burden of the past" is never negligible, that it’s always there. We can discuss this a bit later with respect to Susan Howe.

* * * *

RvH: You proposed that we begin with Susan Howe's recent critical book, The Birth-mark (1993); her work rightly enjoys a great deal of currency among writers and readers committed to experimental poetry. My Emily Dickinson (1985) and The Birth-mark raise issues that pertain particularly but not exclusively to current avant-garde writing. She is not concerned in her critical prose, though, with contemporary writing, so our construal of her criticism in relation to contemporary poetry may become a little unfair. The evaluative criteria at work in these prose-books may not be quite the ones she would invoke in assessing contemporary poetry. All the same, the authority of her very engaging criticism does bring into prominence among her readers certain ways of assessing poetry that I want to disuss with you.

Generally, she has an ambitious anti-formal understanding of poetry--ambitious because she asks anti-formality to do a lot of work. Dickinson's "formlessness"--her syntactic and orthographical idiosyncrasies--has been understood by her editors as a "lawlessness" that has to be disciplined into regularity, conformity (Birth-mark, 1), and Howe accepts this view of Dickinson as anarchist transgressor. The opening of My Emily Dickinson says that "In prose and in poetry she explored the implications of breaking the law just short of breaking off communication with a reader." (My Emily, 11) Howe charts the American antinomian tradition as a subterranean vein of wildness. She cites Thoreau, you remember, to the effect that "in literature it is only the wild that attracts us." (Birth-mark, 18) This recent book suggests not that such wildness is one among many resources for American writers, but rather that the best writers, like Dickinson, set themselves completely apart from the normative social institutions that attempt to govern the art and imaginative life of America. She cites Pierre Macherey with approval when he says, arguing for a kind of autonomy of literary texts, that "the work has its beginnings in a break from the usual ways of speaking and writing--a break which sets it apart from all other forms of ideological expression." (Birth-mark, 46) What she prizes in Dickinson and American literature generally is a standing apart from the dominant social institutions whose authority is implied by conventions of spelling, syntax, prosody, and publication. For W. S. Merwin, Philip Levine, and any number of her contemporaries, free verse has no such grand significance, and few of her contemporaries are seriously engaged in syntactic experimentation. Howe's anti-formality is a throwback to that of Williams, Pound, and other modernists, who strove to discover new systems of order--the variable foot, the ideogrammic method. More than once she speaks of Dickinson asserting "a new grammar"--of the heart, of humility (My Emily, 21, 13). Howe, after Derrida, sees the slippage of signification as systemic to language (My Emily, 13), but it is the systemic orders of language that structure her expectations of meaning in matters.

MP: First of all, I don’t agree that My Emily Dickinson and Birth-mark are "not concerned . . . with contemporary writing." The are contemporary writing, and most readers, I would guess, are much more interested in what Howe’s take on Dickinson tells us about Howe’s own poetry rather than what it can teach us about Dickinson. Also both books have poetic passages and she is consciously trying to produce a new genre, loosely based on Charles Olson’s Call Me Ishmael, Williams’s In the American Grain, and so on. These books ar, so to speak, borderworks– part poetry, part critique, part autobiography. As for specifics, although I don’t care much for Macherey and for Howe’s habit of throwing in "big name" critics–-a sign of her insecurity, I would say, since she was, for so long, a marginalized poet- I think this particular Macherey quote serves Howe well. For her, poetry is always oppositional, always a form of calling into question the dominant culture." As for "wildness," by the way," I don’t think Howe means free verse. Free verse, after all is now the norm, the staple especially of the poetry of the sixties and seventies like Merwin’s and Levine’s. Her deconstructions of linearity are more radical than theirs.

But let’s turn to the larger question of poetry / theory. Howe and such poets as Charles Bernstein have been accused of being "too theoretical," too programmatic rather than naturally lyrical. Yet surely Louise Gluck or Frank Bidart or Robert Pinsky also have a "theory," a poetics that informs their work, even if they don’t write the sort of essays or manifestos one finds in Bernstein’s Content’s Dream or Howe’s Birth-mark. Can poetry ignore theory? (We know theory can ignore poetry, don’t we?).

RvH You ask whether poetry can ignore theory. The answer is plainly yes, and that is disturbing. The fact seems to be that many estimable contemporary poets do not attend closely to the discourse known as literary theory. I tried in 1990 to assemble a collection of essays on this subject. I gave up the project because so few poets I asked wished to address the issue at all. Literary theory in the United States is a professional academic discourse that competes for readers, authority, and prestige with the traditional genres of literary production. My colleague W. J. T. Mitchell said in 198x that we live in a golden age of theory, and that the traditional literary genres are not so distinguished now. The academic discipline of literary studies is hierarchically structured, and this is the view from the upper regions of the structure. The yield of literary theory for what I recognize as literary issues is often so slender that the principal significance of the field seems to be the construction and distribution of professional authority. When theorists engage with contemporary poetry, as Jameson does with Bob Perelman's "China," the results are unimpressive. Poetry seems to resist theory.

MP. I would argue slightly differently. It’s true that, within academe and its leading journals, poetry plays a slight role, but then so do fiction and drama. The most egregious instance of this is American Literary History, where poetry seems all but nonexistent, unless it can be construed as a cultural symptom. But ALH does not focus on theory either and neither does Critical Inquiry in its recent incarnation. These journals focus on Cultural Studies and the articles printed recall the pre-New Critical 1930s in their zeal to establish "context" and cultural discourse, never mind the poem or novel in question. At the same time–and here’s the irony-- poet-theorists like Howe, Bernstein, and Steve McCaffery have found that their essays are in great demand in these journals: Critical Inquiry publishes work by Susan Stewart, ALH published Bernstein, and so on. And I notice these essays are not written in conventional academic prose; Stewart, for example, writes very personally and collages things together. It’s as if the editors have no "use" for poetry as such but are geuninely interested in larger discussions of the poetic and its place among other discourses and so on. So when you say that "poetry" is of no interest to theory, I’d respond, true, if you’re talking about conventional poetry à la Pinsky and Hass but not true where the poetry itself is a little more challenging.

RvH: I have to admit that I resist Howe's anti-formality partly because it's so much the poetic doctrine of the 1960s--long since discredited for me--fortified by later academic literary theory; and yet I very much share her commitment to a concept of literary autonomy. The academic understanding of autonomy that Macherey goes on to argue for, beyond the passage Howe cites, is not, however, independence as I would have it, because the literary text, for him, is always secondary to other ideological uses of language. Literary language parodies ordinary language. (Macherey, 53) This is a common way of seeing literary language once formality has become a sign for social conformity. I've learned from East German writers that the concept of literary autonomy, despite the critiques of western writers and scholars, is a precious and powerful thing. As Ernst Bloch suggests, poems express a wish to speak and live otherwise. It is not just that a communist poet, like Tom McGrath, adheres to a mirror-image of a capitalist economy and society, and surely not that East German poets meant to articulate some capitalist imaginary in a communist society. A long aesthetic tradition, however compromised and maligned, holds out the possibility, as anarchism does too, of unaffiliated opposition, a rare and indefinite alternative. "Mystery is the content," Howe says. "Intractable expression." (Birth-mark, 143) "Poems and poets of the first rank," she had earlier said, "remain mysterious." (My Emily, 27) Howe is less politically predictable than Macherey in this regard, because she will not restrict the literary text to a parodic, secondary relation to ordinary language.

MP. I like that Ernst Bloch quote very much and I agree with what you say about autonomy. And Macherey’s old-line Marxism now seems quite beside the point.

RvH. One problem with Howe’s advocacy, however, is that it settles too patly on the side of so-called formlessness, or mutilation, glaring across at the stodgy repressive patriarchs of Order. The unacceptable axiom is that conventional forms of syntax and prosody stand for established social orders. I join Howe in insisting on the literary and political resources of a tradition of poetic autonomy, but without wanting always to read those resources simplified by some inversion of conventional form. Rigorously formal poets like Turner Cassity and Philip Larkin are staunchly resistant to the norms of literary and social institutions, despite the familiar analogies drawn between metrical order and political authority. Howe tends to describe conventional form as merely shallow or referential in a stable way to societal order. When she speaks of Anne Bradstreet's poems wearing "a mask of civility, domesticity, and perfect submission to contemporary dogmatism," I remember that the civility of art often implies a critique of the brutality of the society outside the poem. (Birth-mark, 113) Resistance to the symmetries of conventional forms is commonly thought of as particularly honest, and formality as duplicitous. I have been reading a lot of Paul Celan lately and see in him too a commitment to an art that indicates formally--principally in terms of diction--a historical rupture or wound in postwar poetry. Celan lost his family, as you know, to the Nazis and his native culture to Stalinism. In a sense, his historical experience is everyone's; the significance of the holocaust and of Stalinism is global, and for that reason the case for imitative form here seems especially strong. But most American readers of poetry witness that rupture in Celan from a historical distance. The familiar argument that contemporaneity is post-prosody (a development of the axiomatic equation of conventional form and established social order that Howe does not pursue)--that there can be no lyricism after Auschwitz, to modify Adorno--finds support here because of an American willingness to borrow trouble. I feel no right to claim that my culture, which has shown remarkable coherence in the past half-century, needs to display a relation to cataclysms of any kind; nor do I see that an attack on syntax or prosody is a particularly acute way of criticizing social orders. Although I can be persuaded by Howe that Dickinson's resistance to political and social order shows up in her orthography, my generation cannot be so easily charmed by assertions of necessary relations between form and political allegiance.

MP: Now here is where we really do disagree. If you believe, as I do, that form can never be separated from something called "content," then of course the choice of form is itself a statement. Take the heroic couplet. It was a marvelous form for Pope and Swift and they did wonders with it. But today, the very appearance of heroic couplets, say, in the TLS, is a signifier of "light verse," something fun and parodic, not meant to be taken too seriously. In France, as Jacques Roubaud argues in The Death of Alexander, the alexandrine was the straightjacket that controlled all verse till the mid-nineteenth century when Baudelaire wrote Les petits poèmes en prose and Rimbaud tried both prose poetry and "free verse." And now there’s no going back. You won’t find a single French poet, I don’t think, writing regularly in alexandrines. And if they did, there would have to be a good reason, the desire to deconstruct some other form, for example.

In the case of Larkin, it occurs to me that actually his "form" is appropriate to his meanings: both are quite retrograde. One thing his form "says" is that English poetry took the wrong turn when it welcomed Pound and Eliot and Williams and that it’s time to return to the good old stanzas of Hardy and Houseman. And that goes nicely with his dislike of strangers, immigrants, Americans, Jews, new social measures, etc. It’s true that, say, John Ashbery experiments with pantoums, villanelles, and other obscure forms. But he is playing with those forms, and his standard rhythmic contour, as many critics have pointed out, is the purposely unmusical, ungainly, "scratchy" rhythm we find in "Houseboat Days" as well as in his so-called pantoums. These are gaming frameworks.

Two further points. I am confused by your reference to the sixties-- hardly a very "experimental" time in poetry when you scratch the surface. Allen Ginsberg didn’t write especially "experimental" poetry; he adapted the Whitman line to a wonderfully exuberant, baroque performance mode. The poetry is often very good but no more radical than his ideas and sentiments. What other sixties poets do you have in mind?

RvH [respond here?]

I don’t, in any case, see the relevance to Susan Howe. But I also want to say-- and this is my second point-- that experimentation is not ipso facto a good thing. There are plenty of "experiments" that are merely boring: for example, Richard Kostelanetz’s many texts using generative structures. But I’m saying that real poets inevitably and even unconsciously will create new forms so as to represent the world they live in. John Cage is the great example of this. He doesn’t set out to "experiment"; he’s really quite empirical–-trying to capture the noises and images we actually live with.

RvH: Perhaps there is some confusion between us. I do not mean to be enforcing a content/form bifurcation. My claim is that Cassity and Larkin are formally and thematically resistant to the literary culture in which their books circulate. My understanding is that the Anglo-American literary culture is predominantly academic and liberal or left-center in its political affiliations. These two poets often express frankly illiberal views, and they do so in strenuously metrical verse that violates the dominant literary taste for free verse. My point is less that Larkin and Cassity attack certain social institutions than that they demonstrate by their work that fine art is producible from their point of view, from their position, politically and poetically. The quality of their poems underwrites their ideological and aesthetic views. This is what Eliot called an "aesthetic sanction."

Too often resistance in the literary culture is understood as being something that comes from the left, that seeks freedom from convention, but there is no reason to think of the center of American literary opinion as that of the Republican Party. Larkin and Cassity are oppositional poets in that they oppose not the rightist drift of the state's political center but instead the center of the literary culture that actually reads them. In this sense, they are confrontational. Most of the poets spoken of as oppositional are actually not terribly far from the left-liberal center of the academic literary culture, however far they are from the right-center of American politics, i.e., from the audiences that are indifferent to poetry.

MP. Here you have a good point–but I think it proves my point. Cassity and Larkin, as you note, return to strict metrical forms that accord with their opposition to the dominant left-liberal orthodoxy of the Academy. But another way of saying this would be that they’re retrograde both formally and thematically! I am hardly the advocate of the flaccid "liberal" free verse of the sixties/seventies (Bly, Kinnell), but do you really believe one can go back to a pre-World War II mode so readily?

Then, too, Cassity and Larkin represent different things. Cassity may be positioning himself against the left-wing academic orthodoxy, as you note, but that in itself seems like a fairly trivial pursuit (i.e., taking on the left-wing English Department!) and perhaps it accounts for Cassity’s near-total obscurity. I doubt whether ten people reading this dialogue have ever heard of him. The case of Larkin is more complicated because he was hardly writing with an eye to the Left-literary culture of the British universities but for what was still a literary culture–of the TLS, New Statesman, etc. where in fact he was immediately successful. In the Britain of his time where only 7% of 18-year olds went to university, it was hardly the university that valorized (or rejected) new poetry. No, Larkin was picked up by middle-brow culture and the professors came on board only afterward.

 

RvH: [TRANSITION NEEDED, to come back to issue of formalism] It seems odd to me that Howe expresses so little appreciation for the pleasures of formal fulfillment, because her own writing is exceptional among avant-gardists particularly because she has an extraordinary ear for the recurrences of sound and stress that fortify sense. She says, in Hopkins-like prose, that "A lyric poet hunts after some still unmutilated musical wild of the Mind's world." (My Emily, 105) Her access to the traditional lushness of language distinguishes her writing from that of most other avant-gardists. Here I don't mean those tight, tough passages that conform to her expressed poetics but rather passages like the one that closes the first section of The Nonconformist's Memorial (1993):

Half thought thought otherwise

loveless and sleepless the sea

where you are where I would be

half thought thought otherwise

Loveless and sleepless the sea (Nonconformist's Manual, 42)

This little strophe formally concludes a lyric of twelve additional lines that I won't quote, because here I want only to show that Howe uses the resources of formal symmetry to resolve matters that arise in her less formal explorations. There are the echos of syllables such as "thought," "-less," and "where" that give shape to these lines, and the syntactic structures too echo each other. But the prosody of the strophe is especially worth remarking. The first line has a rhythmic structure--two dactyls--that does not quite conform to the syntactic structure, with its pause after the first two syllables. The second line adheres to a dactylic rhythm, but with an extra stress concluding the line. The third line gives up on the falling rhythm altogether, but builds on the pattern in the previous line of two trisyllabic feet plus a concluding stress: x/x x/x /. And the third line resembles the first in exemplifying a shift of pace after the caesura: both lines effectively speed up after their pauses, as though fitting more syllables into their second "halves." It is remarkable that a poet who insists vigorously on the mutilation of form is so drawn to pastiche of the narcotic lyricism of nineteenth-century British poetry. I always feel the allure of such an ear's working, line by line, but after hearing such song I obviously listen skeptically to the anti-formal rhetoric of her prose. The best objection to imitative form is strengthened by the example of passages like this one from Howe: conventional forms do much else beyond imitating social structures; a too reductive allegorization of form reduces the resources of the art.

Although resistance to conventional form is a prominent feature of the literature that she esteems, Howe's more interesting evaluative criterion is intensity. Much of The Birth-mark is devoted to writing about forceful experiences and feelings. In My Emily she doubts that before World War II "any work of European imagining" exceeded "the rough-hewn intensity" of Mary Rowlandson's narrative. (The Iliad, the Medea, and Lear are presumably not rough-hewn; it took fascism and the holocaust to roughen up European literature.) The frontier experience itself obviously provided writers a highly charged subject matter, and that is a large part of the intensity Howe admires. Yet at the heart of her sense of poetic intensity is not just the deprivations and brutality of the frontier but the rivalry of poetry and religion. American poets, to their credit, are drawn to "Divinity's sovereign source." (My Emily, 55) The particular poetic intensity she analyzes is inconceivable in strictly secular poetry. Her own poems, and those of Michael Palmer too, draw often on Christian aspirations to a language comprehending divinity. Is contemporary academic criticism ready to return to the connections between poetry and faith that engaged American critics from the 1920s to the 1950s? Probably not: our academic intellectual climate is insistently secular and ironic. On the evidence of Howe's project, though, the modernist view that secularization diminishes poetic resources is far from passé.

But beyond the resources of particular subject matter, she treasures still more intellectual intensity. Her account of American literature might be extended to explain the Americanness of writers like Louise Glück and Frank Bidart, as well as Dickinson and Rowlandson; the scope of her assessment is grand beyond the immediate terms of her narrative. The assessment of poetry in terms of intensity is uncontroversial insofar as strong feeling is what is most commonly expected of poetry; but even a veteran reader of poetry feels the appeal of a prophylactic against the mediocrity one witnesses inevitably as one follows an art season by season. The worst charge against contemporary poetry is that it is merely industrial product.

There is of course a hazard in the ardent pursuit of intensity: it has been too easy for critics of the last thirty-five years to mistake forceful subject matter for emotional, intellectual, or linguistic intensity. There are some poems, like Bishop's villanelle "One Art," in which the intensity of the language seems to derive from the force of the subject--in this case, loss. The formal resources of the villanelle concentrate her force and dramatize the speaker's willfulness, which is the poem's subject too. In a poem like "One Art" the distinction between subject and treatment seems tenuous. But James Merrill's work, for example, rarely has patently forceful subject matter, though the pressure he puts on his syntax and prosody in some poems produces an intensity less obvious than that of, say, Anne Sexton's poems. One can distinguish clearly between form and content in Merrill's and Sexton's poems. And for one the intensity is all in the style, and for the other in the content. Howe herself is drawn to extreme scenes, i.e., to the power of subject matter itself, such as the eating of raw horse liver (Birth-mark, 125-26), and she recognizes this as a problem:

. . . I am concerned that so much of my work carries violence in it. I don't want to be of Ahab's party. I want to find peace. Anyway, you balance on the edge in poetry.

(Birth-mark, 177)

But her work gets its more important intensity from the pressure on her style. Her diction, syntactic patterns, and sound structures forge a "terse, tense, sometimes violent" style--"Chaos cast cold intellect back" (Singularities, 34)--suitable to the intellectual ambitions she most admires. (My Emily, 84) In many of her poems an austere refusal of eloquence, fluency, or formality acts as a structure of concentration comparable to that of the villanelle for Bishop. It is important when reading with Howe for intensity to remember that extreme subject matter is only one part of the intensity that matters most in poetry; often it only feeds a prurient appetite for violence.

Although I do often read as Howe does, looking for nodes of intensity, a line or a poem, this evaluative criterion is for me dialectically involved with its contrary: range. I cannot imagine a steady diet of Plath's "Lady Lazarus," "Daddy," and Bidart's "Ellen West," though these are exceptional poems that belong in any anthology of postwar poetry. To some extent the issue is whether one assesses poems one by one, in which case intensity counts a great deal, or whether poets are measured by their overall work. Eliot argued that minor poets are adequately represented by a small number of poems but major poets must be understood in terms of their entire work. Coleridge similarly says that "Our genuine admiration of a great poet is a continuous under-current of feeling; it is everywhere present, but seldom anywhere as a separate excitement." (Biographia Literaria, ed. Engell, I, 23) Coleridge does not stipulate the quality of that feeling, but if among the qualities one seeks are flexibility, proportion, judgment, variety, one is unlikely to be at peace with the results of an assessment in terms of intensity alone. Much of the poetry I appreciate is not of the first intensity in terms of subject or style, and most of Bishop's is not either. There are pleasures to be had from the fluency and elegance of poems that deliberately avoid extremity and intensity. How can we justly account for the Horatian pleasures of, say, Robert Pinsky's recent poem "Impossible to Tell"? Not with Howe's evaluative criteria alone. I use an intensity criterion often in sorting out the poems to read to friends, to study with students, or to discuss in an essay. But I long for ways of talking about the humaneness of poetry that moves away from the strains of intensity and force in order to express an appreciation for a more normal or ordinary life. Howe cites Thoreau as saying that poetry is "exaggerated history." (Birth-mark, 96) Exaggeration isn't satisfying in the long run.

MP: Your commentary on intensity interests me a great deal because I almost wrote my PhD dissertation on the history of the meaning of "intensity" as poetic criterion. Before the 19th century, "intensity" was NOT especially valued; it’s very much a Romantic invention (Blake, Keats, Baudelaire, Poe) and often comes down to the Moderns in the form of the privileged moment, the epiphany. "Can you recommend some novels of the first intensity?", Yeats wrote to Dorothy Wellesley. In this sense Howe is most certainly a Romantic. But intensity needn’t mean (your page ?) "strong feeling"--it can mean, as for Eliot, "intensity" of the poetic process, the making. I think this is also what Keats meant when he said "The excellence of every art is in its intensity" or what Poe had in mind when he declared that one should excise those parts of Paradise Lost that lacked intensity. It's not a matter of feeling but a matter of language. And here I can't see how you can invoke Frank Bidart. To me his language is generally quite slack as is Pinsky's--I'll return to this. As for Louise Glück, that's "intensity" on the surface level–a breathless invocatory lyric that doesn’t seem to have much substance. Not enough difference, always the same note of High Seriousness. Also I would never describe Bishop's "One Art" as having "intensity of language." It's too reasonable, rational, crafted, and willed.

RvH: Even after we have agreed that intensity of language or style is the proper goal of poetry, we are going to disagree greatly as to what constitutes intensity of language in particular poems. In many poems we recognize intense language by its appearance of being worked by the poet; Lowell's style in Lord Weary's Castle might be an instance of this. The intensity of language characteristic of seventeenth-century English poetry is reasonable, rational, crafted, and willed, isn't it? I don't sense any necessary conflict between these qualities and what I recognize as intensity of language. But in other sorts of poems intensity seems the result of strenuous selection, of an austerity that was not part of Lowell's, Donne's, or Marvell's intention; Bidart's poems seem intense to me in just this way. Perhaps, though, we can agree that the common notion that language becomes intense when its style imitates its sense is mistaken.

MP: Well, here I’d like to come back to the notion of relatedness, fitness, making every word count–which is, of course, another form of "intensity." One of my favorite seventeenth-century poems is George Herbert’s "The Windows," which begins:

Lord, how can Man preach thy eternall word?

He is a brittle crazie glasse;

Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford

This glorious and trascendent place,

To be a window through thy grace.

And the poem then develops the metaphor of priest = stained glass window, both worthless " unless "illuminated" by "light" (the grace of God). One of the great feats of this poem is that when the tenor and vehicle of the metaphor fuse in the last stanza, they do so phonemically as well as semantically, with the words "in," "Mingle," "bring," "flaring," with the final rhyme "flaring thing" / "ring" bringing the point home with great finesse. It’s the sort of effect Robert Lowell can only strain for in Lord Weary’s Castle because–-and here is a topic we have barely touched on–the sort of correspondence between the natural and the spiritual ("Doctrine and life, colours and light, in one") Herbert took as a given can’t be willed by a secular poet of Lowell’s day without a good deal of strain.

RvH: [TRANSITION?] Pope's principle ("The sound must seem an echo to the sense") presides over most critical discussion of poetic style: prosody is appreciated most often as an imitation of sense. But this is a way of rendering the sound of poetry servile to the ideas that critics specialize in explicating. It is consoling to a reader to find some neat parallel between the sound structure of a poem and what one wants to think of as its point. But sounds provide other pleasures that do not fall into line so obediently. Sound is a sense experience, and it has its own being beyond its instrumentality. The sensuality of poetry, generally speaking, is greater than that of prose. This is often part of the mysteriousness of poems: their sensual shapeliness, altogether aside from their paraphraseable sense. This side of poetry sometimes seems just unknowable, in the sense that it can't be reduced to paraphrase.

MP: I agree, but do you really think most critics today talk about sound at all? Or about syntax and diction? The typical discussion of, say, Ashbery (where there has been a great deal of criticism) is about meaning, voice, larger structure (or lack thereof) of specific poems, and so on, but critics (Harold Bloom is a case in point) rarely stop to so much as mention that Three Poems is in prose, not verse or to ask what that might mean. So we have to look more closely at the materiality of poetry and here I want to have a closer look at a poet you’ve praised as especially "humane"–Robert Pinsky. Pinsky's poems are barely poems at all. Or at best, to use Coleridge’s distinction, works of fancy, not imagination. Take the celebrated "History of My Heart":

One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat

Rolled beaming from a taxicab with two pretty girls

Each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall

Across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd

Shopping at Macy's: perfume, holly, snowflake displays.

Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked

Over her school vacation, the crowd swelled and stood

Filling the aisles, whispered at the fringes. . . .

"Do not retell in mediocre verse," Pound said, "what has already been done in good prose." Let's first of all transfer Pinsky's loose blank verse into prose:

One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat rolled beaming from a taxicab with two pretty girls each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd shopping at Macy's, with its perfume, holly and snowflake displays. Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked over her school vacation, the crowd swelled and stood filling the aisles and whispered at the fringes. . .

Bob, what have I lost here? I've added nothing except that in line 5 I got rid of the colon and made it syntactically smooth with "with its" and in the case of line 8 I added an "and." I wouldn't even have had to do that. So: what does Pinsky gain by lineating his text and by using tercets? I can’t imagine. Now, my objection to Pinsky is not at all that he uses traditional "form" but that he doesn't do anything with the form. Just as, say, Ferlinghetti doesn't do anything with the "formlessness." I think--forgive me for being cynical--that what he does gain is that his reader processes the work as a "poem," which is to say that the tercet form is meant as a signpost whereby the reader is prompted to relate "History of My Heart" to great poems of the past. But I actually think the cited texts looks/sounds/reads better as prose because that's what it is internally. If Pinsky were writing short stories, though, the audience would be more stringent. I honestly believe that he couldn't get away with a lot of his flatness if he admitted he were writing prose. Short-story audiences are, in fact, more demanding than poetry audiences even if they're bigger.

Let me specify: "One Christmastime": why not "One Christmas"? The "Once upon a time" note is merely cute. Fats Waller "rolled beaming . . .": no defamiliarization here. Wouldn't it have been interesting if Fats Waller were scowling? Or something else that might arrest our attention. "Thick downy snowfall"--what else? What do you now know about December on 34th St. you didn't know before? "The busy crowd." Are crowds usually "unbusy." If not, why not just "crowd," as Hemingway might have put it. "The crowd swelled and stood / Filling the aisles"--again, what else? All this is, of course, part of Mother's Tales for Young Bob, "romance of Joy, / Co-authored by her and the movies, like her others." But you know what: it's not credible because if it were really a scene co-authored with the movies, it would be more graphic, more striking--more interesting. And the word do nothing to character their purported speaker. I think immediately of Frank O’Hara’s great New York poems like "A Step Away from Them"–poems that make us "see" Times Square (same locale!) as if for the first time, what with the blonde chorus girl clicking and the "Negro" who is "langorously agitating."

So when you and others tell me Pinsky is "humane," I honestly don't know what this means. He just seems like everyone else--a very nice guy, maybe a little more sensitive and articulate than other nice guys but why should I be interested in this story about his mother, a story that is not much more than a New Yorker profile? What Pinsky lacks here is "le mot juste"--I don't mean language per se but language that is memorable, graphic, precise.

RvH: Your questions about the opening of "History of My Heart" revolve around the issue of ordinary language: what is the function of ordinary diction and syntax in poetry? Some poets invest highly in striking diction and surprising syntax, but Pinsky puts more in story than many of his contemporaries do. In order to carry stories, I think, his style is well suited to a plausible narrator who speaks in sentences--not just syllables--that can be articulated easily. One recognizes such a style as familiar, more fluent than intense or startling. Only in the sixth line, beginning with the second sentence--"Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked . . ."--does the diction indicate any flight. "Change" might be capitalized to indicate a season of transformation, and "toys" might be lower-cased to suggest Mother Hubbard more than Mother Pinsky. That is, when the diction becomes most obviously a mouthful, with the "Chi"/"cha" echo, the fantastic quality of even ordinary discourse surfaces for a moment. The poet is not taking credit for the figurative potentiality of the language here, as Merrill often does; ordinary life at Macy's every Christmas season is about transformation and play. But the syntax moves one's mouth and attention through an abrupt change, with a crisp four-word sentence following the forty-four word opening sentence. Pinsky is not displaying virtuosity, but the form of the poem is giving sensual shape to the movement of attention through the story. As for Fats Waller, he is the black man bringing sumptuous, sexy excess to the white world.

Part of your objection to Pinsky's language, I take it, is its conventionality, which truly is a prominent feature of the style here, and this has everything to do with the claim that his work exhibits an unusual degree of what I called humaneness. He does not try to make everything graphic or particular. The "two pretty girls," say, are adequately represented, it seems, by this abstract, conventional phrase. And similarly he tells of his father punching "the enraged gambler," in a corny scene fit for the movies, as he suggests. The poem affirms the occasional adequacy of conventional categories of expression and representation: "Shepherds and shepherdesses in the grass"; "the back room of Carly's parents' shop." That's a fit. He presents this conformity with some amusement or irony--

To see eyes "melting" so I could think This is it,

They're melting! Mutual arousal of suddenly feeling

Desired: This is it: "desire"!

--but it is nonetheless a match: conventional language will serve in some instances. And in just these moments the ordinary, conventional structures in which speakers of this language live are affirmed. The implication of the poems then is that the ways that we have found as groups to live together are significantly humane.

And not just any groups. The term "humane" is obviously slippery, exactly because it is meant to be inclusive above all; hence the continuing currency of the Latin tag from Terence--"nothing human is alien to me." The relevant counter-term is less "inhumane" than "partisan." Poets like Whitman and Williams attempt to elude the exclusions of partisan analysis, though of course they do not always avoid partisanship: they represent themselves as poets who wish to refuse certain kinds of partisanship; they claim a measure of inclusiveness that runs against the dividing lines of camps that their readers are expected to recognize. This is not a strictly thematic issue. The refusal of encampment that I am talking about can certainly be expressed through features of style or theme; the important thing is the aspiration toward some inclusive ground of affiliation--humanness, which can mean an attitude toward a political issue or a style that is not devoted to a narrow range of effect. The esteem for the humaneness of certain poetry rests ultimately on rhetorical properties, not on a claim about the nature of a particular poet as person.

You say that Pinsky just isn't sufficiently interesting, but I think this poem is quite rich. The richness I appreciate is not in the graphic language of the poem (and you would surely agree that elsewhere in the poem there are teeth-marks on the railing, etc.--enough graphic particularity to satisfy me), but rather in the overlap of various representations of the production of desire, the elaboration of some ornament, and the communication of a sense of identity. Is there another poet who can so nicely account for the mix of selfishness and mother love?

She wanted to have made the whole world up,

So that it could be hers to give. So she opened

A letter I wrote to my sister, who was having trouble

Getting on with her, and read some things about herself

That made her go to the telephone and call me up:

"You shouldn't open other people's letters," I said

And she said "Yes--who taught you that?"

--As if she owned the copyright on good and bad,

Or having followed pain inside she owned her children

From the inside out, or made us when she named us,

III

Made me Robert.

I think it is quite interesting that a predictable, ordinary moment can be transformed by someone like Fats Waller emerging out of nowhere. Why should he wish to transform the moment for a crowd of strangers, since he has surely had lots of adulation already? The answer suggested by the poem is that it pleases one to give gifts, to make someone else feel lucky. It is erotic to give pleasure, to make someone else feel desire. And yes, it is selfish too to want to see oneself desired in the eyes of others, to read one's name everywhere in the world. What we commonly take to be the type of selfless devotion is a mother's love. Pinsky relates how his mother's intelligence is bent to pursuing her claim on the identity of her children.

[BOB, THIS LAST PARAGRAPH IS NOT CLEAR TO ME. NEEDS SOME RECASTING].

MP: Bob, you make the most eloquent case possible for Pinsky’s "History of my Heart" but it does leave me with some questions.

First, "ordinary language." I’ve just written a whole book [Wittgenstein’s Ladder] on Wittgenstein’s theory that "ordinary language is alright," showing how "poetic" ordinary language can be. But Pinsky’s is patently not ordinary language–that is the language that we actually use–-but calculated to "seem" ordinary. In ordinary conversation we don’t in fact talk about people "beaming from a taxicab" or "the crowd . . . whispered at the fringes." It’s not at all what Wittgenstein had in mind when he cautioned us to see how fascinating OUR ordinary sentences (e.g., "The rose is red") can be when we try to understand their uses.

Second, you say Pinsky’s language is conventional, and intentionally so. Well, which is it: ordinary or conventional? Because once something is conventionalized, it’s not really ordinary, is it?

Third, and most important, a few words about your discussion of the passage about mother love, a passage you obviously admire. Evidently, if I understand you correctly, you find the passage effective because you feel that this is what mother love is like, that it nicely embodies the tension between a mother’s "selfless devotion" and her urge to pursue "her claim on the identity of her children." Your argument here is, as you surely know yourself, extra-literary: you are praising Pinsky for presenting what you take to be a psychological truth about motherhood.

But suppose I don’t agree that this is a "just" representation of what you call "the mix of selfishness and mother-love"? Perhaps our difference here is gendered. From my perspective (and since we’re being extra-literary, I write as myself a mother and grandmother), Pinsky’s representation is that of the slightly patronizing successful poet-son, who is here imputing motives to his middle-class non-professional mother. The lines "She wanted to have made the whole world up,/ So that it could be hers to give," imply that she really has nothing of her own to give anyone, that she lives vicariously through her children (the Jewish Mother cliché)-–a statement that may or may not have been true of the poet’s mother but that doesn’t quite ring true poetically (fictionally) because the reader senses that there’s more involved here than the poet admits, that he is casting his mother in a role. Then, too, I find, the passage irritating because the poet claims to know what it is that makes his mother tic, knows that she wanted "copyright on good and bad," wanted "to own her children / From the inside out." But the reader is given no alternative: we have to take Pinsky’s representation on faith, even though, for all we know, the real Mrs. Pinsky had a secret lover and a rich sex life in middle age!

But, you may respond, isn’t this by definition what lyric is: a subjective representation of events, the expression of the first person? Romantic lyric, yes, but not all lyric and the voice is the problem here. For even if we don’t subscribe, as I don’t, to the current orthodoxy about the cultural construction of the subject, with its concomitant axioms about the end of individualism the "waning of affect" and "new depthlessness" (Fredric Jameson), it seems problematic, at the end of the twentieth century, to give the individual voice so much authority, so much knowingness. The facility of interpretation ("Or having followed pain inside, she owned her children /From the inside out") flies in the face of the ethos of the late twentieth century, however one chooses to construct it.

I don’t mean to beat up on Pinsky: God knows he is a much more accomplished poet than many now writing, and he is a sensitive and interesting essayist and commentator. But I would conclude–and here I do think we differ–by suggesting that if one takes Pinsky as paradigmatic contemporary poet, one is bound to have the feeling, which you said you have, that poetry just isn’t a very vital part of the culture any more. I think the reason you feel this way is that what you suggest Pinsky does "well" is really done equally well in essays, short stories, and especially in film! So to come back to Pound’s caveat: "Do not retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose!"

And here I come back to my original proposition that poetry is the language art. Readers continue to come to poetry because, unlike film, or the personal essay, or video, or even the novel, it contains language charged with meaning. The pleasure of the text, in, say, Susan Howe’s Frame Structures, is that the word "mark," which appears and reappears in the first of Howe’s four books in that collection, "History of the Dividing Line," without registering fully on the reader’s consciousness, is now charged by the knowledge provided in the new title piece, the autobiographical memoir "Frame Structures," that "Mark" is the name of Howe’s father as well as of her son. Mark deWolfe Howe is central to her story, for the quest for paternity stands behind the poet’s obsession with the New England and Ireland of her parents, her documentary history of Buffalo and Boston, her vignettes of Beacon Hill ancestors and friends. After a while, every "mark" provided begins to fit into the puzzle.

I find that students are thrilled when they begin to "see" these connections, not because Howe has anything unique to "say" about paternity or ancestry, but because her poems enact such amazing labyrinthine paths that allow for exploration of the issue. On the "flat" documentary surface, the poet’s very real pain appears at the interstices of the text, and the reader experiences what Aristotle called the pleasure of recognition. It’s a pleasure, in any case, that is currently very widespread as a large alternate poetry culture is making itself heard through reading series, internet projects, websites, conferences, festivals, etc. A poetry world literally humming and with which I can hardly keep up!


### JANUS-FACED BLOCKBUSTER by MARJORIE PERLOFF

    --- Frank O’Hara, "To Hell with It"

Making my way through the 1250 pages of Cary Nelson’s monumental new Oxford anthology (the book, which weighs in at almost five pounds, is heavier than my three-pound Dell Latitude laptop), I couldn’t help thinking of the above lines from "To Hell with It," a poem not included in this anthology, in which, incidentally, O’Hara is allotted only eight pages as compared, to, say, the fifty-two pages devoted to Melvin B. Tolson’s eccentric epic "Libretto for the Republic of Liberia," whose every word demands annotation, making it a kind of obstacle course for even the most dedicated reader. In Nelson’s anthology "subject matter" reigns supreme, as does what O’Hara, in his witty "Personism: A Manifesto," calls "forced feeding":

Too many poets act like a middle-aged mother trying to get her kids to eat too much cooked meat, and potatoes with drippings (tears). I

Don’t give a damn whether they eat or not. Forced feeding leads to excessive thinness (effete). Nobody should experience anything they don’t need to, if they don’t need poetry bully for them. I like the movies too. And after all, only Whitman and Crane and Williams, of the American poets, are better than the movies. (O’Hara, 498).

The Oxford Anthology of Modern American Poetry, functions, I’m afraid, as just such a middle-aged mother. For whom, one wonders, can this solemn, ideologically charged anthology conceivably be designed? Today’s undergraduate, according to all surveys, has little familiarity with poetry and may well be intimidated by it. Even the book’s closest textbook rival, the equally thick Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry (2d ed., 1988), which, like the Oxford, begins with Whitman and Dickinson, casts a wider net: it covers both American and British poetries of the twentieth century. But weight is hardly the only problem. How, one wonders, is the neophyte or graduate student, much less the "informed" general reader, to get a sense of twentieth-century American poetry– or, for that matter, of poetry tout court-- from an anthology, a good portion of whose pages are taken up by texts classifiable as "poetry" only because they are lineated or, in the earlier part of the century, use meter and rhyme. Here, for example is "The Heart of a Woman" by the African-American poet Georgia Douglas Johnson:

The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn

As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on;

Afar o’er life’s turrets and vales does it roam

In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.

The heart of a woman falls back with the night,

And enters some alien cage in its plight,

And tires to forget it has dreamed of the stars

While it breaks, breaks, breaks, on the sheltering bars. (1918)

These chug-chug iambic pentameter stanzas rhyming aabb remind one of a Hallmark card; indeed, so slack is the diction, so hackneyed the phraseology and sentiment of this little lyric, that the copy editors evidently failed to catch the error in line 7: the heart "tries" not "tires" to forget it has dreamed of the stars." Not that, in the scheme of things, it especially matters.

Or, for a late century equivalent of "The Heart of a Woman," here is a snatch from the Native American poet Adrian C. Louis’s "Petroglyphs of Serena" (1997):

About a year after Serena

died in a car wreck

I saw her again–sort of spooky, but

Ghost sightings are common around here. (p. 1137)s

Suppose I get rid of the lineation:

About a year after Serena died in a car wreck, I saw her again–

sort of spooky, but ghost sightings are common around here.

What makes the first version "poetry"? If lineation is the identifying criterion, why does the anthology include no greeting-card verse or some of the wonderfully clever lineated ads of the period? Why no folk or pop songs? The answer is that the above poems are included, not as poems but as exemplars of specific racial, ethnic, and political groupings and generally function as proponents of a radical politics. Practically speaking, this means, especially in the thirties and forties, the inclusion of poets who identified themselves as Communists, along with African-American poets protesting the condition of their people, women poets writing of their victimization, working-class poets writing of factory injustices and poverty, and so on. In headnote after headnote, we are told such things as that Herman Spector "worked for a year on the WPA Writers’ Project" (p. 371), that "Joseph Freeman worked for the Soviet News Agency TAAS from 1925-31" (p. 375), or that Sol Funaroff "was an important organizer for the proletarian poetry movement in the 1930s" (p. 626).

In the later sections of the anthology, in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet system and the end of the Cold War, the Communist themes of Funaroff and Freeman gives way to a straightforward identity politics. Of the twenty-five poets born after 1946 who are included, twenty-one are poets of color. Adrian C. Louis, for example, whose poetry (cited above) gets sixteen pages as compared to John Ashbery’s eleven, is an "enrolled member of the Lovelock Paiute Indian tribe" who "opts to tell harsh truths about both white and Indian cultures" and "displays an articulate bitterness about the humiliation and demoralization his people continue to suffer." As for the four white poets in this section, Ron Silliman is presented as a working-class poet, C. D. Wright represents the poor rural South, Carolyn Forché was a human rights activist in El Salvador, and Mark Doty writes about what it means to be HIV positive.

Such inclusion and the larger roster it represents would be perfectly acceptable if the Oxford Anthology were upfront about its political agenda, if it presented itself explicitly as a collection of the writings of subject and oppressed peoples as well as social and political activists. Nelson’s earlier Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory, 1910-1945, published in 1989, succeeded in its more modest aim, which was to open up, and rethink the restrictive Modernist canon–a canon, so Nelson pointed out, largely elitist, white male, and bourgeois–in the interest of the revival of a host of "lost" poets of the period who published in the alternative press, wrote broadsides, union songs, and so on. If the Established Greats (T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost) played no part in Repression and Recovery, the argument was that they are so well-known that there’s surely room for a revisionist study of those whose voices have been lost.

As such, Nelson’s study constituted an important opening of the field. But in the case of the Oxford Anthology, Nelson obviously had to satisfy the corporate interests of his very mainstream capitalist publisher. And therein lies the rub. "This collection," we read on the back cover, "is the first to review the twentieth century comprehensively. It presents not only the canonical poetry of the last hundred years but also numerous poems by women, minority, and progressive writers, only rediscovered in the past two decades." Here the "not only . . . but also" format is something of a trap, implying as it does that those good old "canonical" poets were not "progressive" and that there were not sufficient numbers of women or minority writers among them.

What, in this scheme of things, is poetry anyway? And if "modern American poetry" is, as Nelson claims, "one of the major achievements of human culture" (a phrase that reminds me of nothing so much as Al Gore’s claim that "our army is the greatest in the history of the world"), what makes it so "major"? One is hard put to find answers to these basic questions in this anthology, which lurches uneasily between the extremes of High Modernism and agitprop. There is nothing revisionist, for example, about the selections from Eliot and Pound, which are almost identical to those in the Norton or Prentice-Hall anthologies of American literature. Even the annotations, Nelson tells us, are taken from Prentice-Hall, so that "Prufrock," The Waste Land, Pound’s Usura Canto and the first part of Canto LXXXI ("Zeus lies in Ceres’ bosom") have a wholly familiar look. Frost, Stevens, Marianne Moore, H.D., and Hart Crane, are treated with similar benign neglect.

Fortunately, there are a few exceptions. Nelson’s selection from William Carlos Williams is revisionist, presenting, for the first time in an anthology the complex experimental prose/verse medley of 1928 "The Descent of Winter." Again, the anthology provides us with the entire text of Gertrude Stein’s "Patriarchal Poetry" (not, to my mind, one of her best works despite its modish title), and with a generous selection from Charles Reznikoff’s Testimony, with its dramatic collages based on actual court records. The Sylvia Plath selection includes, aside from the usual anthology pieces, all of the difficult and fascinating Bee Poems.

But on the whole, Nelson plays it safe with the Moderns and more than safe–let’s say conservative–with their post-World War II successors from Theodore Roethke, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Elizabeth Bishop, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton, to Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, to Robert Bly, W. S. Merwin, James Wright and Charles Wright, Robert Pinsky and Robert Hass. The anthology gives no indication that the Modernist aesthetic of the earlier generation and its diluted form in the Lowell-Berryman generation that follows is precisely the aesthetic of non-engagement Nelson has taken such pains to castigate in Repression and Recovery. The converse is also true: the poems in the post-1946 section, in which the anthology shifts over to excluded or underrepresented minorities, are largely those that a Roethke or Merwin, a James Wright or Charles Wrigh,t would castigate as sloppy, badly written, sentimental, overtly and annoying ideological, and excessively shrill and/or bathetic. Finally–and this is especially regrettable, the anthology gives short shrift to those radical poets who were in fact on the Left but wrote in unconventional and experimental forms. Louis Zukofsky, Lorine Niedecker, and George Oppen are allotted a mere six pages a piece, as compared to eighteen for Roethke, a poet whose reputation has steadily declined as the derivativeness of his long sequences has been more fully understood! Evidently, the radical politics of the Objectivists are not sufficiently overt. The omissions in the next generation are even worse: what about, for starters (alphabetically), Bruce Andrews, Rae Armantrout, Charles Bernstein, John Cage, Clark Coolidge, Lyn Hejinian, Jackson Mac Low, Bob Perelman, Jack Spicer, and Rosmarie Waldrop? This list comprises a mere ten of dozens and dozens of poets much more accomplished and challenging than are Sandra Cisneros or Sesshu Foster. And what about–to take African American poets not included, evidently because they are male poets who don’t write straightforward lyrics about oppression and victimization– Will Alexander, Ted Jonas, Nathaniel Mackey, Clarence Major, or Lorenzo Thomas?

As a survey of our century, in any case, the Oxford anthology is not likely to convince anyone that our poetry "is a major achievement of human culture." Indeed, there is a good deal of just plain bad writing here. Take, for example, Genevieve Taggard’s 1940 poem about America’s refusal to accept refugees from Nazi Germany during World War II called "Ode in Time of Crisis." Here are the first two verse paragraphs:

Now in the fright of change when bombed towns vanish

In fountains of debris

We say to the stranger coming across the sea

Not here, not here, go elsewhere!

Here we keep

Bars up. Wall out the danger, tightly seal

The ports, the intake from the alien world we fear.

It is a time of many errors now.

And this the error of children when they feel

But cannot say their terror. To shut off the stream

In which we moved and still move, if we move.

The alien is the nation, nothing more or less.

How set ourselves at variance to prove

The alien is not the nation. And so end the dream.

Forbid our deep resource from whence we came,

And the very seed of greatness. (p. 339)

This earnest outcry about immigration policy would not qualify as a newspaper editorial or political speech because it so vague and cliché-ridden. "Fright of change" is not exactly graphic, and those unspecified "bombed towns" predictably "vanish / In fountains of debris" forcing the "stranger" to come, of all things, "across the sea." The poem is not even accurate: children don’t "say their terror," and the immigrants who once came freely to the U.S. are said to constitute "a stream / In which we moved," a locution that suggests that coming to America was a process characterized by its steady even flow. Even politicians would have to have better phrases that "our deep resource from whence we came" or "the very seed of greatness."

"Ode in Time of Crisis" does nothing with rhythm or sound and defies every notion of the mot juste that had prompted and animated the revolution of Modernist poetry. More important: far from being "language charged with meaning," as Pound would define poetry, Taggard’s vague phraseology testifies to the simple-mindedness of her message. I write here as myself one of those refugees whose plight Taggard claims to address, although my family, like thousands and thousands of others, was one of those lucky enough to be admitted to the U.S. We arrived in the fall of 1938 and were treated with a decency and kindness toward the "stranger" unparalleled, I believe, by any other nation at the time. In England, for example, we would have been interned as enemy aliens; in Argentina, we would have been left to fend for ourselves. True, U.S. immigration policies hardened by 1940 and one can make a case for the cruelties of American isolationist policy in these pre-War years. But one would never know from Taggard’s meaningless phrase-making what was at issue, who was concerned, what the politics in question were all about, and so on. Hers is just vague rant, as inaccurate and bland as the patriotic sloganeering it opposes. To expose students to such discourse cannot, I submit, turn them on to poetry.

Why is Genevieve Taggard in the anthology? According to the headnote, she worked for various Communist causes in the twenties and in 1934 married Kenneth Durant, "who headed the American office of Tass, the Soviet News Agency. This placed her at the center of left politics in the ‘red decade’ of the 1930s. Tass would employ several Spanish Civil War vets, including poet Edwin Rolfe, in the 1940s, and Taggard came to know them well," and so on. What, precisely, are undergraduates of 2001 to make of these facts? Are they to admire the "radicalism" of what were at best idealists duped by one of the most repressive and violent totalitarianisms of modern times? Are they to believe that this is "poetry" despite its reductive ideology? Or conversely that its poetic blunders aside, this poetry carries an "important" message?

One may argue, of course, that Taggard’s poems constitute a tiny fraction of what is a wide and catholic selection of texts and that, furthermore, a very different anthology like the Library of America two-volume American Poetry: The Twentieth Century (on whose editorial board I served) also included some six pages of Taggard’s work (although not this particular ode). But here the difference is instructive. The Library of America volumes devote some 2,000 pages to American poets from Henry Adams to May Swenson (born 1913). In such an encyclopedic anthology–an anthology where the major poets like Eliot, Pound, Stevens, and Williams get roughly a hundred pages a piece, it is imperative to include every poet of every persuasion so as to fill out the historical picture. As such American Poetry serves as a reference tool as well as a collection of major authors. Then, too, the Library volumes have no headnotes or explanatory material; they merely present. It is the packaging and relative weighting in the Oxford anthology that seems so problematic.

And finally, there is the issue of confusion. Suppose a prospective student has read, for the first time, Stevens’s "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" (pp. 127-28) and the brilliantly devious and racy (but not race-based) "Songs to Johannes" by Mina Loy (see pp. 150-61)? In order to do so, s/he has presumably learned something about what Olson was to call the "lyrical interference of the ego," and the need to "tell all the truth but tell it slant." Her reading in Whitman, Dickinson, and Eliot would have taught her that a poem is not a direct statement, that although, as Wittgenstein put it, it "is written in the language of information, it is not used in the language-game of giving information." She has been taught by reading Moore and Crane that word choice is central to poetry, that poetry thrives on intensity, density, complexity, and especially the relatedness of one item to another, of meaning to sound as well as to its visual representation, so that it can become "news that stays news." She has encountered irony in its various guises. Loy’s "love songs" are nothing if not ironic as in "My finger-tips are numb from fretting your hair / A God’s door-mat / On the threshold of your mind" (p. 150). And she has learned that twentieth-century poetry is characterized by its rejection of Received Truths. Stevens’s "Thirteen Ways," for example, deals with the myriad ways the consciousness tries–and fails-- to find a constant that governs the flux of daily life. "When the blackbird flew out of sight, / It marked the edge / Of one of many circles" (p. 128).

It is difficult for the survey-course student to absorb all these ideas so as to read modern poetry with some degree of competence. But what happens when, after weeks of studying the above, the instructor assigns, say, Ray A. Young Bear’s "It is the Fish-faced Boy that Struggles," which has passages like the following:

He knew it was the next day

when he woke. He could hear the chickens

shuffling about. It was no longer warm.

the daylight dissipated as it came in

Through the hole in the center

he turned on his side

and bumped into a small tin bucket.

he reached over and drew it close.

a first smell,

he couldn’t define it, but gradually

as he slushed it around, he recognized

his vomit, yesterday’s food. (1166)

This, I would maintain is not "bad" poetry; it isn’t poetry at all, at least not by any understanding of what poetry is from Aristotle to Agamben, Sappho to Sapphire. It is merely prose chopped into line lengths–essentially reportage. And there is something condescending about the claim that we should call Young Bear’s text poetry just because he’s a Native American or that the haiku written by Japanese Americans who were interned in camps during World War II can be treated as a "collective enterprise" (see pp. 718-20) that bears witness to their sufferings. Japanese literature after all, is itself one of those "major achievements of human culture" Nelson talks about, and so Japanese Americans don’t need this kind of faux-patronage. Indeed, there is something deeply troubling about the notion that Asian-American students in the year 2001 want a poetry that presents their forebears as so many outcasts fifty years ago or that African-Americans can only be "represented" by the poetry of victimage and complaint.

No doubt, it is this earnest do-good mentality Frank O’Hara had in mind when he quipped, "Nobody should experience anything they don’t need to, if they don’t need poetry bully for them. The movies are good too." All that "cooked meat" and "potatoes with drippings" may make us forget that the writing and reading of poetry is a form of passion, that it is one of the great pleasures of life afforded to anyone who cares to partake of it. But pleasure was obviously a low priority in the making of this anthology. As a visual object, the book is ugly, its paper thin, its annotations crowded and hard to read. As for the accompanying website (http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps), it makes the task of reading the poetry in question even more forbidding, including, as it does, selections from advanced scholarly essays guaranteed to make the work to be analyzed even more remote, more difficult to digest.

If the numbers on amazon.com are to be trusted, thus far the new Oxford Anthology is lagging way behind the 1988 Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, so far as sales are concerned. Neither is really satisfactory as a textbook but since the Norton covers British as well as American poetry, I suppose it would be more usable in beginning courses. The Oxford Anthology, in any case, provides us with a cautionary tale, which is that editors and their publishers must have greater respect for their actual readers. Recent studies and newspaper articles suggest that students are once again drawn to the pleasure of the text, to the aesthetic quality of literary work. The buzz is that book groups are burgeoning around the country–book groups that read Proust and Joyce, Kafka and Faulkner, Eliot and Moore. New experimental poetries are flourishing on sites like the Ubuweb, and avant-garde conferences are taking place in out-of-the way spots around the world, assessing the impact of Dada on Language Poetry or of the Situationists on Canadian visual poetics.

In this context, it is hard to imagine that young people are going to be excited about poem X just because it recounts an industrial scandal in a Southern factory during the Depression or poem Y because it bears witness to the poverty that forced a particular African-American woman to have an abortion. These issues matter but it isn’t clear how or why they profit from being versified. Indeed, they belong to the world of "prose" also known, as Gertrude Stein put it in the prose poem reprinted here, as Patriarchal Poetry. "Patriachal Poetry resign resign," we read in this text. And again, "There is no use at all in reorganising in reorganising. There is no use at all in reorganising chocolate as a dainty."

For the past decade, John Ashbery has been producing a new book of poems almost every year—a situation that, for just about any other poet, would signify excess. Can the lyric poet, one wonders, continue to produce at this rate? Has Ashbery’s vision changed dramatically, his experience taken a new turn? Has there been a noticeable stylistic shift? Have the poet’s advancing years (Ashbery is now over seventy) brought the wisdom Yeats claimed as the compensation for what he called ‘bodily decrepitude’?

It is probably too soon to assess the overall trajectory of Ashbery’s poetic career. But as this dazzling new collection makes clear, his ability to produce memorable poems uniquely his own remains undiminished. True, one could argue that there is a generic Ashbery poem. The speaker usually begins with an observation -- ‘Disturbing news emanates from the wind tunnel’ or ‘Out on the terrace the projector had begun / making a shuttling sound like that of land crabs’—an observation that involves seemingly absurd detail or non-functional simile. An Ashbery poem characteristically collages childhood memories, present conversations, and interweaving narratives —almost always non-sequiturs that nevertheless add up to the sensation of being alive, here and now, in the bizarre, media-filled culture of the late twentieth century. The bemused and beleaguered Ashbery voice is immediately recognizable in such locutions as ‘I know I shall one day come to the reason / for manners and intercourse with persons. / Therefore I launch my hat on this peg’, or ‘I am wondering where to stand—could that group of three / or four others be the beginning of the line?’ Ashbery’s demonstrative pronouns remain largely indeterminate, so that when we read a line like ‘We doctored it all up’ (‘A Suit’), we cannot know what ‘it’ refers to. The preferred verse form continues to be a stanza of irregular length made up of long, loose free-verse lines, most of them enjambed. As for wisdom, the ‘I’ of these poems is just as uncertain, hesitant, self-deprecating, and receptive to new possibilities as was his younger self. He never pronounces, never generalizes, never claims to have the truth or even to experience the privileged moment when the poet sees into the life of things. If anything, these poems end, as does the brilliant ‘Sonatine Mélancolique’ with the memory of

    A time when we too were out of step

    and the whole sentient world offered to bathe us—

    pale bluster, flubbing today again and again.

Despite such marked continuities, the new poems are recognizably different as well. For one thing, they are more relaxed, more humorous, more willing to let it all hang out than were those in, say, The Double Dream of Spring or Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. Memory has become increasingly obsessive, playfulness and camp more acceptable, and dialogue with a ‘you’ who is a close friend or lover becomes the normal lyric mode as does the telling of tales that invokes a shared past. Bowdlerized citation used for burlesque effect—from pop song, poetry, newspaper headline, opera libretto, French novel, advertising jingle--has become a stock-in-trade: every line points to something we have heard before—but where? In this free-wheeling new landscape, the anxiety of such poems as ‘These Lacustrine Cities’ and ‘"They Dream Only of America"’ has given way to a certain measure of serenity. ‘Yes,’ we read at the conclusion of ‘A Suit’, ‘I could have told you that some time ago.’ But since we have no idea what ‘that’ is, the ending is not exactly reassuring either.

Take ‘Redeemed Area’, whose suggestive title encompasses all sorts of possibilities, from actual ‘redemption’ to its antithesis—an area ‘redeemed’ for the sinister uses of others. The poem opens with an absurd bit of dialogue, or is it monologue?

Do you know where you live? Probably.

How can one not know where one lives? Never mind: the narrator goes on to tell a more or less realistic story about one Abner (Li’l Abner of the comic strip?) ‘who ‘is getting too old to drive but won’t admit it’ and who goes out in search of ‘ cough drops / of a kind they don’t make anymore.’ But the ‘drugstore has been incorporated into a mall’ and ‘All the houses / are owned by the same guy, who’s been renting / them out to college students for years, so they are virtually uninhabited.’ It all makes good sense: students are known to wreck rental units and urban blight has brought decay to the ‘old’ neighborhood.

But just when we think that the poet is giving us a ‘normal’ account of suburban sprawl, a surreal note is introduced:

A smell of vitriol and socks pervades the area

like an open sewer in a souk. Anyway the cough drops

(a new brand) tasted pretty good—like catnip

or an orange slice that has lain on a girl’s behind.

If this sounds like mere clowning around, the drawing of absurd comparisons and making of foolish similes, think again. The smell really may be a mix of sulfuric acid and sweat (from dirty socks), thus reminding the poet—in a moment of comic alliteration, of an ‘open sewer in a souk’—a souk or Oriental bazaar. Cough drops do taste medicinal and hence perhaps like extract from the catnip plant, and as for that orange slice—how, one wonders, would lying on a girl’s behind affect its taste?

Here, as so often in Ashbery’s lyric, ‘nonsense’ turns out to be oddly apropos. For, as in Joyce’s ‘Araby,’ exoticism soon mutates into the merely tawdry. Consider the next stanza:

    That’s the electrician calling now—

    nobody else would call before 7 A.M. Now we’ll have some

    electricity in the place. I’ll start by plugging in

    the Christmas tree lights. They were what made the whole thing

    go up in sparks the last time. Next, the light

    by the dictionary stand, so I can look some words up.

    Then probably the toaster. A nice slice

    of toast would really hit the spot now. I’m afraid it’s all over

    between us, though.

This is at once hilarious and poignant. By the time one comes to the last line, one realizes that the speaker has been fooling around so as to ease the pain that parting from a lover is about to bring. The absurd suggestion about the Christmas tree lights suggests that the loss of electricity has marked the end of a holiday season, a season of love and pleasure. The inconsequential shift from the Christmas lights to the dictionary stand and then to the toaster, turns the ‘redeemed area’ of the title into a space of chaos and impending trouble. But the poet refuses to mourn: ‘Gradually,’ he declares, "everything will return to normal.’ Indeed, ‘I have adjusted the lamp, / morning’s at seven’.

This last line illustrates the thickness of Ashbery’s poetic texture. ‘Morning’s at seven’ comes, of course, from Robert Browning’s Pippa Passes: ‘The year’s at the spring, / And day’s at the morn; / Morning’s at seven . . . God’s in His Heaven-- / ‘All’s right with the world!’ But Ashbery isn’t drawing a simple contrast between Pippa’s cheeriness and his own chaotic life. For ‘Morning’s at Seven’ is also the title of Paul Osborn’s 1939 Depression drama—a Midwestern family tale where things get a bit more complicated. Perhaps, the poet suggests ruefully, a bit of distance will give him the perspective he needs:

    the tarnish has fallen from the metallic embroidery, the walls have fallen,

    the country’s pulse is racing. Parents are weeping.

    the schools have closed.

    All the fuss has put me in a good mood,

    O great sun.

Again, the absurd quickly yields to pathos and back again. Tarnish is what is left when the metal flakes off, not vice-versa. The ominous and generic news—‘the walls have fallen . . . parents are weeping / the schools have closed’—is never explained; indeed, these are no more than generic signs of doom. And yet ‘all the fuss has put me in a good mood’: if the world is indeed in such a sorry state, how sorry can the poet feel for himself? And so, in a wry allusion to Apollinaire’s ‘Soleil cou coupé’ (in Zone), we have, finally the invocation ‘O great sun.’

Ashbery has many imitators both in the U.S. and the UK but not one who can match these tonal shifts and thick allusions. Indeed, it is the density of reference and vocal range that also makes Ashbery’s poems—early and late—so hard to talk about. David Herd’s new full-length study makes a valiant effort to chart the poet’s entire career to date, to determine ‘What are the continuities? What are the differences? . . . . How does one volume lead to, or away, from another?" He proposes to do this by examining the relations of the poems to their period and rehearses, with great skill and thorough scholarship, what Ashbery was doing when, whom he spent time with, what he was reading, and what was happening on the political and cultural front. The anomalous Tennis Court Oath (1962), for example, is read in the context of the poet’s alienation in his early Paris years—an alienation heightened by Cold War culture in the U.S., as defined by critics like David Riesman, Vance Packard, C. Wright Mills, and Philip Rahv.

But compelling as is the attempt to link Ashbery’s poems to The Lonely Crowd or The Hidden Persuaders, the poems don’t quite come alive as a result. Why, after all, is The Tennis Court Oath so different from the work of Ashbery’s Paris friend Harry Matthews on the one hand, his Harvard /New York friend Frank O’Hara on the other? Why is his response to Philip Rahv so different from Robert Lowell’s? Nor does it help to posit generalizations like ‘How and whether to risk the sublime in a cultural climate in which poetry is failing to communicate are problems which persist throughout Ashbery’s poetry of the 1970s.’ To what poet would this diagnosis not apply? In his first chapter, Herd notes that Ashbery himself has repeatedly expressed the desire to be more fully understood. But understanding can only come from reading the poems themselves, word for word, and line by line, with as much knowledge of genres, conventions, and poetic topoi as possible. Indeed, Herd’s comparisons of Ashbery to Pasternak or Pascal are finally no more satisfying than earlier links drawn between Ashbery and Keats, Ashbery and Emerson. No labels seem to stick to this great mercurial poet, who has, in his own words,

. . . wriggled farther into an indeterminate space

that was actually a mood, or many moods, one overlaying another

like gift wrap.


### Review Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems by John Ashbery. 

Marjorie Perloff

John Ashbery’s earlier Selected Poems (Viking, 1985) drew on the first
thirty years of his career, from Some Trees (1956) to A Wave (1985). The
new Selected covers the twenty years since 1985 in roughly the same
number of pages. Indeed, the volumes have a nice symmetry: each covers
ten books of poems (the most recent, A Worldly Country [2007] is not
included); each volume is reduced to approximately one third of its length.
Ashbery’s preference, in making these selections, seems to be for shorter
poems: just as the first Selected reproduced only one section of the booklength
Three Poems, the second gives us only a short section (V) of the 216-
page Flow Chart.
Because Notes from the Air marks Ashbery’s eightieth birthday,
readers are sure to wonder how the later work compares to the earlier.
The first thing to note, perhaps, is that the evolution of Ashbery’s lyric mode
is startlingly similar to that of Wallace Stevens. Both poets gained
recognition relatively late (Stevens was forty-four when Harmonium was
published, Ashbery forty-nine when he published Self-Portrait in a Convex
Mirror); in both cases, the central parameters of the verse (even when, in
Ashbery’s case, it is prose) remain the same, but in the late work, the
rhythms become more relaxed, the vocabulary and syntax more informal
and inconsequential, and there is a new willingness to take risks, even if that
means striking out now and again. In late Ashbery, as in late Stevens, “the
edges and inchings of final form” (“An Ordinary Evening in New Haven”) are
2
never far away, but Ashbery (unlike Stevens) assumes a playful stance to
what one of his titles calls “Autumn on the Thruway.” Laughter, laced
though it is with anxiety, echoes through these pages. Given the times we
live in, these poems suggest, the comic modality—burlesque, parody, satire,
and always a measure of irony —is surely our Necessary Angel. If Ashbery
is, in Harold Bloom’s lexicon, the ephebe of Stevens, he is an ephebe for the
information age, our blog and cellphone-crazed universe in which, to cite the
first poem in Some Trees, “Everything has a schedule if you can find out
what it is.” Never, after all, have there been more rules than in the
protocols that govern our daily digital activity: click one incorrect letter or
space and you’re done for. But is there a “right” click? And where are the
words that haven’t been used a thousand times by others? Indeed, doesn’t
everything we hear sound as if it’s always already been said?
A 1995 poem called “By Guess or By Gosh” is a case in point.
Ashbery has always made connections between high art and popular culture,
as in his Popeye poem “Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape.”
But the juxtapositions of “By Guess or By Gosh” strike a new note of
absurdity, beginning with the faux parallelism of the alliterating title, with its
play on “By Hook or by Crook,” a cliché that turns out to be quite relevant to
this poem’s narrative. By Gosh: the near obsolete, coy expletive (the only
person I’ve heard use it recently is George Herbert Walker Bush) has
nothing whatever to do with guesswork, but it nicely sets the stage for
Ashbery’s hilarious fantasy about false portents, omens, and coincidences.
The poem opens with an asymmetrical couplet, recording what sounds
like an overheard conversation:
Even so, we have forgotten their graves
I swear to you I will not beat one drum in your absence.
Whose graves? We don't know, but our interest is immediately aroused by
the play on «drumbeating.» As Ashbery phrases it, his declaraton can mean
3
either, «I refuse to do one thing to promote your cause,» or, conversely,
«While you're away, I will be so sad I won't play one note of music on my
instrument.» Either way, the drumbeat now introduces a tale of absurd
proportions, in which a Phoenician sailor (known to us from The Waste Land,
first as Eliot's own alter ego in the Tarot pack and then in «Death by Water»
as Phlebas the Phoenician) turns into Wagner's ghostly Flying Dutchman,
trying to «garner a spouse» so as to break the curse that keeps him forever
on the high seas. The story (whether fiction or film) becomes sillier and
sillier, the narrator commenting that «perhaps» the girls available have
rejected our hero for «the lack of something called 'personable,' / though I
think I don't even want to know what that is.» But the casual phrasing
should not fool us: Ashbery has the whole thing worked out to the last
detail. «It was in a garage where tire irons jangled in the breeze,» that the
poet first heard the story, those tire irons recalling the grappling irons that
attach Captain Daland's vessel to the dreaded ghost ship of the Flying
Dutchman legend. Wagner, for that matter, provides the link between
Phoenician sailor and Flying Dutchman, Tristan and Isolde providing a key
motif for The Waste Land, which also cites Wagner's Parsifal.
But what is the point of these conjunctions? A clue is provided in the
next lines, «I'll follow / my heart over warm oceans of Chinese lounge
music.» The reference, the websites tell us, is to the «lost art of
improvisational guqin music,» recently revived as lounge music in elegant
hotels or restaurants. The guqin is a plucked seven-string Chinese
instrument of the zither family, known as «the insrument of the sages,»
because Confucius singled it out for praise. So, the poem suggests, forget
those ominous legends, those gloomy Wagner plots and Waste Land images:
you can always sail those «warm oceans» of music, available, at least, «until
the day the badger coughs up that secret.» Follow, in other words, your
own lights, for in the public world:
4
Confused minions swarmed on the quarterdeck.
No one was giving orders anymore. It fact it was quite a while
since any had been issued. Who's in charge here?
Can't anyone stop the player piano before it rolls us
in the trough of a tidal wave? How did we get to be so many?
It is all very zany but also serious. Like a player piano, the narrator sees
himself as operating on automatic, unable to avoid the «Death by Water»
that is the fate of Flying Dutchman and Phoenician Sailor. And it is not only
the narrator who is threatened. The final question above echoes Eliot's (or
rather, Dante's), response to the trimmers in the vestibule of hell, «I had
not thought death had undone so many.» Even the prospect at poem's end
of a visit to the local movie theater can't make us forget that fact.
Ashbery's mode, in this and related poems, is not that of collage;
indeed, it is not, as is generally claimed, disjunctive and fragmented. On the
contrary, this is a poetry that exploits syntactic continuity and a kind of
sequential normalcy, only to subvert continuity at every step by injecting
alien items and unexpected references into the sequence. It's a matter of
careful construction, of finding the Flaubertian mot juste or, in this case,
phrase juste. Only someone as learned, curious, wide-ranging, and expert
in all manner of writing, music, and media works, as is Ashbery, could bring
it off. No wonder his poetry has proved so impervious to imitation.
The title poem of Notes from the Air is remarkable in this regard. It
begins:
A yak is a prehistoric cabbage: of that, at least we may be sure.
But tell us, sages of the solarium, why is that light
still hidden back there, among house-plants and rubber sponges?
The equation of the first line makes no sense, even as a potential riddle, for
what similarity can there be between the long-haired, humped bovine
animal, native to the uplands of the Himalayas or Mongolia, and “prehistoric
5
cabbage”—a term that sounds ridiculous but, as I learned from a quick
Google search, refers to kale, whose giant curly cabbage-like leaves
evidently provided food for giant insects in prehistoric times. Yak (not only
the noun but also the verb yak) and kale: a moment’s thought reveals that
the language game in which these two items have a necessary connection is
the crossword puzzle, both monosyllables serving to fill up those tricky
blanks created by y’s and k’s in final position.
But cabbages and yaks (unlike Lewis Carroll’s “cabbages and kings”)
have a further link. In travel narratives about the Himalayas—and they are
legion--we often read about tired mountaineers, descending the trail and
looking forward to a delicious meal of yak and boiled cabbage. Or again,
Ashbery may have been thinking of the 1960 Sci-Fi film (based on Arthur
Conan Doyle) called The Lost World, in which Professor Summerlee nearly
gets eaten by a prehistoric cabbage, and his rival professor named
Challenger taunts, "Well, Summerlee, you may not like vegetables, but they
certainly like you.» The animals of The Lost World are dinosaurs, not yaks:
but the latter are almost as exotic.
Can all this material really be packed into a single line, and, if so, how
is the unsuspecting reader to process it all? Is Ashbery resorting to the very
crossword puzzle tactics he is lampooning? «Notes from the Air» is indeed
difficult but no more difficult, I would posit, than the poems of Eliot or
Pound, Stevens or Stein or Moore—Ashbery's Modernist precursors. True,
there is a line of poetry popular today that extends from the minor Beats to
the «natural speech» lyric still ubiquitous in the popular journals, a lyric
perhaps chiefly designed for the poetry reading, where the audience can
«get it» as soon as the performance ceases, there being nothing to crossreference,
whether from Milton or Mahler, Rimbaud or Redbook, James Bond
or James Dean. But, despite the perennial demand that poetry should
satisfy the «common reader,» whoever that is, difficulty has been a quality
6
of the poetry that matters throughout its history. The difference, in the
twenty-first century, is that it has become more essential—and also more
fun—to look things up.
Or so I felt, rereading «Notes from the Air.» The first line makes
everything else in the poem happen. Once we understand that the poet and
his fellow «sages of the solarium» are fooling around, one lazy afternoon,
doing the crossword puzzle or perhaps swapping stories about old movies
and travelogues, we can track the process whereby time, pleasantly wasted
late in the day, late in the season, becomes two stanzas later, the time that
is «running through die holes / like sand from a bag. And these sandy
moments / accuse us, are just what our enemy ordered.» In the Stevensian
meditation that follows, the poet comes to see that it's time to ask, «Where
shall we go when we leave?», time to eat those «fruits halved for our
despairing instruction» and make sure there are «chairs enough / for
everyone to be seated in time for the lesson to begin.»
Once that «lesson» is learned, it's time to move on to another poem,
one that begins, say, with the line, «We were warned about spiders, and the
occasional famine.» The illogic of continuity is Ashbery's signature, whether
from line to line, poem to poem, or volume to volume. Age, to paraphrase
another bard much cited by Ashbery, cannot wither it.

### “The Radical Poetics of Robert Creeley,” Electronic Book Review, Marjorie Perloff

no less than water
no more than wet
--Robert Çreeley, “Funny”1
The Creeley memorials of 2005-06—festivals, readings, conferences,
and especially website testimonials-- have been so overwhelming in their
homage and veneration for the late great poet, that we tend to forget that it
was not always been thus, that Creeley’s distinctive poetics have been the
object of curious misunderstandings. For all his bridge building, his
geniality and the uncanny ability, in his later years, to persuade friends and
colleagues from one camp to accept and work with those of another, Creeley
was and remains sui generis—a poet who fits uneasily into the very schools
he is regularly linked with. A “Black Mountain” poet whose actual poems
have very little in common with the work of his mentor Charles Olson or his
close friends Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, a younger friend and
strong advocate of the Objectivists, who had little taste for the citational
poetics of Zukofsky or the strenuous political/philosophical engagements of
Oppen or Reznikoff, an affiliated member of the Beat community, whose
spare writing could never be confused with the expansive-ecstatic mode of
Allen Ginsberg or Gregory Corso, a composer of dense, abrupt first-person
lyric in an age of loose, expansive and encyclopedic “longpoems”—Creeley
remains sui generis.
How, then, to characterize a Creeley poem? We might begin by
considering the arguments made early in the poet’s career, and still in
2
evidence, against Creeley’s lyric mode. Take, for starters, M. L. Rosenthal’s
now notorious commentary on Creeley in the well-known survey The New
Poets, American and British Poetry Since World War II, published by Oxford
in 1967. Rosenthal, himself a poet, was an early admirer of Pound and
Williams (he attended many of the famed poetry conferences sponsored by
the University of Maine at Orono), but although he found the occasional
Creeley poem in For Love and Words “touching” and “alive with wit,” he
dismissed the bulk as “brief mutterings . . . or the few shuffling steps of an
actor pretending to dance.” Their humor, “especially in his complaints about
married life,” struck Rosenthal as “too often obvious and easy,” and he
concluded that “the work “demand[s] too little from its author, though the
author demands a good deal of attentive sympathy and faith from the
reader.”
It is a judgment echoed by the eminent Christopher Ricks, now the
Oxford Professor of Poetry, who wrote in the New York Times Book Review in
1973 that “Creeley is at the mercy of his own notions. He would seem to be
a professional quietist and libertarian, but these conventions (e.g. no regular
verse, no standard linear development) turn out to be more cramping than
those of a minuet” (7 Jan. 1973, 5, 22) And in the Yale Review for Autumn
1977, Helen Vendler, comparing Creeley (the occasion was the publication
by Scribners of the Selected Poems) to Olga Broumas, the Yale Younger Poet
for that year, declared, “Creeley remains so much a follower of Williams,
without Williams’s rebelliousness, verve, and social breadth, and his verse
seems, though intermittently attractive, fatally pinched.” And further, “In
Creeley, there is a relentless process of abstraction, of “serial diminishment
of progression”; he purchases composition at the price of momentum and
sweep.” Not surprisingly, in the light of these remarks, Creeley was omitted
from Vendler’s 1985 Harvard Book of Contemporary Poetry, which did
include such exact contemporaries of Creeley’s, as John Ashbery, Frank
3
O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg, A. R. Ammons, James Merrill, W. S. Merwin, and
James Wright.
The publication of the Collected Poems in 1982 didn’t altogether
change this negative mood. “Creeley is not [as claimed by the publisher] a
major poet,” complained Richard Tillinghast in The Nation, for “It has not
been his ambition to address in a sustained manner the large human issues
that are traditionally associated with major poetry” (19 November 1983,
501). The title of Tillinghast’s piece is “Yesterday’s Avant-
Garde”—yesterday, presumably, because “experimental” poetry in the
Pound-Olson tradition was held suspect in the conservative 1980s. Indeed,
the language poets had now appeared on the scene, and Tillinghast takes
the opportunity to disparage the new movement:
Creeley has become a guru to “language poets”—a term whose equivalent in other
arts would be “dancing choreographers’ or “music composers” or “food chefs.”
Literary self-consciousness is as old as poetry itself; every poet is a “language poet.”
In much of Creeley’s work, however, particularly after For Love, language itself is the
exclusive focus, thereby positing an ideal reader who is a philosopher of language.
Wittgenstein would have spent many happy hours with Creeley’s poems. My own
reactions I can sum up variously, depending on my mood, as: (1) this poetry
deliberately avoids communication, for reasons of its own; (2) it is so abstruse that I
lose interest; (3) it is simply over my head. (Nation, 504)
The last disclaimer may be true, given that marvelously wrong-headed
remark about Wittgenstein, who never spent a happy hour with anyone’s
poems, much less those by one of his contemporaries, although, as I
suggested in Wittgenstein’s Ladder, the reverse was certainly the case:
Creeley knew his Wittgenstein well. Other reviewers, in any case, agreed
that Creeley’s poetry “deliberately avoids communication”; in The New York
Times Book Review, Alan Williamson observed that for Creeley, “minimalism
has become more and more an end in itself. . . . Tautology mingled with
4
neutral observation in a John Cage-like faith in the inherent value of
silencing the interpretive function” (March 9, 1980, 8-9).
Like M. L. Rosenthal, Williamson and Tillinghast are what we used to
call academic poets, before the academy, thanks, in no small part, to
Creeley himself, began to welcome poets of a very different stamp. A quiet
revolution has certainly occurred. But what Charles Bernstein dubbed
“official verse culture” –the culture of the leading commercial presses,
journals, and prize-giving institutions—has not changed all that much:
witness David Lehman’s recent Oxford Book of American Poetry, published in
2006. Lehman is a poet with New York school credentials and a PhD from
Columbia who has held a variety of academic posts but is perhaps best
known for his general editorship of the annual Best American Poetry
volumes, one of which he invited Creeley to edit. In the new anthology, a
1000- page blockbuster, Lehman gives Creeley short shrift. Whereas James
Merrill and A. R. Ammons (both born, like Creeley, in 1926) get twenty-three
and fifteen pages respectively, Creeley gets a mere five. In his headnote,
Lehman notes:
Even poets on the other end of the poetic spectrum admire Creeley, as in Donald
Hall’s phrase, “the master of the strange, stuttering line-break.” Hall observes that if
you took a sentence from a late Henry James novel like The Ambassadors and
arranged it in two-word lines, you would have a Creeley poem worrying out its selfconsciousness.
Creeley seems often to substitute speech rhythms for imagery as the
engine of the poem. (745)
What, one wonders, is Creeley’s “end of the poetic spectrum,” a spectrum
Lehman alludes to as just faintly disreputable? One surmises that the term
refers to Black Mountain or Beat or,more broadly, the “Pound tradition”:
Olson too only gets five pages, Duncan, five, Levertov, three, and Ed Dorn is
not included at all. To be called “the master of the strange, stuttering linebreak”
is, in any case, to be treated as eccentric—a poet who has his
limitations, of course, but at least has this one talent--a talent that allows
5
the poet to produce line units that recall “cut up” segments of Henry James.
Moreover, Lehman implies, Creeley’s “substitution” of speech rhythms for
imagery as the” engine of the poem” is somehow aberrant: imagery, after
all, remains, in most accounts, the hallmark of poetry.
From Rosenthal to Lehman, Creeley’s detractors have voiced the same
reservation: Creeley’s lyric is too “minimalist” (“cramped” (Ricks) and
“pinched’ (Vendler), its language too abstract and conceptual, its
communicative channel too often blocked, its subject-matter too far
removed from the “great human issues.” True, Creeley has invented a new
verse form—“the strange, stuttering line-break”—but, we are told, such
prosodic invention, employing those speech rhythms that substitute for the
resource of imagery, is not enough.
Rosenthal, however, concludes his chapter on Creeley with a remark
that points unwittingly in another direction:
Perhaps Creeley’s restraint and cool control is the last stand of genuine sensibility,
against the violence and ruthlessness of twentieth-century civilization. But genuine
sensibility cannot give up its passion quite so tamely: it all seems a little to confined
to settle for just yet.—Perhaps after World War III? If so, Creeley is indeed ahead of
his time.
However we want to take this melodramatic comment—and, sadly, the
reference to World War III no longer seems so far-fetched-- Rosenthal does
seem to sense that Creeley’s “cool control” provides a special measure for
the violence and ruthlessness of our own moment. Keeping this notion in
mind, I want to turn now to a characteristic poem from For Love. Here is
“The Rain”:
All night the sound had
come back again,
and again falls
this quiet, persistent rain.
6
What am I to myself
that must be remembered,
insisted upon
so often? Is it
that never the ease,
even the hardness,
of rain falling
will have for me
something other than this,
something not so insistent—
am I to be locked in this
final uneasiness.
Love, if you love me,
lie next to me.
Be for me, like rain,
the getting out
of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semilust
of intentional indifference.
Be wet
with a decent happiness. (CP 207)
Rain is, of course, one of the most prominent symbols in poetry, whether as
a portent of storm, flood and human destruction, or, conversely—and more
commonly—as the source of life, fertility, and renewal, as in English poetry
from Chaucer to Eliot, or for that matter in East Asian poetry as well, As a
Basho haiku has it:
Spring rain
leaking through the roof
dripping from the wasps’ nest
7
In Romantic and Modernist poetry, the association of rain with the longing
for sexual fulfillment occurs again and again, from Verlaine’s “Il pleure sur
mon coeur” to Thomas Hardy’s “We Sat at the Window,” to Apollinaire’s
calligramme “Il Pleut,” with its visual representation of women’s voices
raining down the page, as if in the poet’s memory [figure 1].
8
Closer to home, Creeley surely knew William Carlos Williams’s 1930 poem
“Rain,” which begins:
As the rain falls
so does
your love
bathe every
open
object of the world—
In houses
the priceless dry
rooms
of illicit love
where we live
hear the wash of the
rain-—2
Here, in what Williams himself once referred to as “the best poem I have
ever done” (see CP, 527), rain is associated with the poet’s desire for an
unattainable love and is contrasted to the indoor world of “dry / rooms / of
illicit love”—a ‘love” associated with the “whorishness” of “metalware” and
“woven stuffs.” The poem’s lineation follows the movement of the rain
“falling endlessly / from / her thoughts”; the poet longs to be “bathed” by
the “spring wash / of your love / the falling rain.” But something fearful or
perverse in his nature prevents it from happening: “my life is spent / to keep
out love / with which / she rains upon / the world.”
Creeley’s poem is at once more intimate than Williams’s and yet also
much more opaque. Written in six quatrains rather than in Williams’s
spatially organized free verse lines, it begins literally enough with the
9
sleepless poet’s awareness of the “quiet, persistent rain” that has been
falling “all night “ The eye rhyme “rain” (in the title), “again,” “again,”
“rain,” would seem at first to function mimetically, sound repetition
conveying the gentle rainfall itself. But syntax undercuts sound, for the
second “again” introduces a new clause with a tense shift and inversion of
word order. Creeley’s is not, in fact, “speech rhythm”: to whom and in
what context would anyone say, “and again falls this quiet, persistent rain”?
The fourth elongated line, moreover, with its alliteration of t’s, emphasizes,
not regularity of rhythm, but an irritating persistence. Indeed, the first
stanza swiftly establishes the poem’s tone of malaise, dislocation,
restlessness.
Hence the shift, in stanza 2, from the rain itself to the poet’s intense
self-questioning: “What am I to myself / that must be remembered, /
insisted upon / so often?” As Creeley’s detractors note, the language is
abstract and conceptual, the grammar ungainly: the question, “What am I
to myself” is guardedly indirect. The key word here is “insisted,” which is
repeated in stanza 4, where the poet wishes for “something not so insistent”
as the falling rain. From “persistent” to “insistent”: the two adjectives are
close enough to be almost interchangeable, but “insistent” has a more
negative connotation. A persistent caller, for example, is not as irritating as
an insistent one—a person who demands your attention, who wants
something. The poet knows this, knows that he can never respond to the
external stimulus—whether it be the “ease” of gentle rain or its opposite, the
“hardness of rain falling”-- casually or instinctively. On the contrary, it is his
condition “to be locked in this / final uneasiness.” Never, it seems, can the
poet be easy.
Note that as readers, we have absolutely no idea why this should be
the case. Unlike, say, the Robert Lowell of “Eye and Tooth,” whose similar
insomnia—
Outside, the summer rain,
10
a simmer of rot and renewal,
fell in pinpricks.
Even new life is fuel—3
links the poet’s present pain from a throbbing cut cornea to a terrifying
childhood memory of something once seen (“No ease for the boy at the
keyhole”), Creeley does not concern himelf with cause and effect, past and
present. The world merely is; it is everything that is the case, and one has
to deal with it as best one can. At the core of “The Rain,” as in most of
Creeley’s poems, early and late, there is mystery—a mystery that no
“conceptual” statement can clear up.
And so the lover turns to his woman and pleads with her: “Love, if
you love me, / lie next to me.” It couldn’t be simpler, or could it? It is she
who must now supply the “rain” that can get him out “of the tiredness, the
fatuousness, the semi-/lust of intentional indifference.” Here the clumsy
catalogue of abstract nouns with the awkward line break after “semi,”
provides a terrifying sense of the paralysis and anxiety that haunts the man
who speaks. Even his “intentional indifference” (perhaps the lovers have
had a quarrel earlier?) is haunted by “semi-lust,” a feeling that can’t be
ignored but is not strong enough to act on either. As for the woman beside
him, we have no idea what she is thinking or feeling, and neither does the
poet. “If you love me” is a big “if.”
After the near breakdown of these two lines—line 21 has thirteen
syllables carrying six stresses and two caesurae--, the abrupt conclusion is
explosive: “Be wet/ with a decent happiness.” “Be wet for me,” is a
common enough phrase used to arouse one’s partner, to strengthen her
desire. Yet, if we come back to the rain symbolism of the first five stanzas:
the curious thing is the breakdown of the metaphor: the beloved’s “wetness”
cannot be that of rain falling; the literal image is of a pool or well that
receives the speaker’s semen: the “hardness of rain,” should, in other
words, be his. The unsuccessful nature of the union is thus implicit. And
11
indeed, the lover doesn’t ask for ecstasy or erotic transport--only for a
“decent happiness.” “Decent’: the strangeness of the adjective is surely a
Creeley hallmark: one can’t imagine another poet who would use it in this
context. “Decent” means “adequate” or “sufficient” as in “we had a decent
crowd last night.” It also means “conforming to accepted standards of moral
behavior,” as in “That was the decent thing to do.” And, by a slight shading,
it means “kind, considerate, or generous,” as in “How decent of her to help
him out.” As for “happiness,” the choice of the abstract noun, echoing as it
does the earlier “tiredness” and “fatuousness,” is almost as puzzling as that
of “decent.” Women aren’t wet with “happiness” but with desire; happiness
comes after fulfillment and even then it is an odd word choice in the context,
suggesting that the poet is restrained by rules of conduct and speaks
indirectly. He is, in other words, a courtly lover.
What kind of poem, then, is “The Rain”? To note, as is customary in
Creeley criticism, that his is a poetry of process rather than product, that it
only discovers what it wants to say in the act of saying it, does not get us
very far, and neither does the application of Creeley’s own famed Olsonian
precept that “Form is never more than the extension of content.” The choice
of stanza form, after all, clearly preceded the individual locutions.
Moreover—and here Creeley parts company with the “open field” poetics of
Black Mountain—“The Rain” is certainly a closural poem: the ending, with its
period, is presented as conclusive: this, the reader feels, is how it is, at least
for now. Indeed, “The Rain” is a highly formalized poem, even as it defies
the dominant conventions of lyric poetry—raw or cooked—at Creeley’s
moment.
“The Rain” is not, for starters, an autobiographical poem that moves
from present to past and back to the present with newly earned insight or
epiphany, like Lowell’s “Eye and Tooth,” or, say, Sylvia Plath’s “Cut Thumb.”
Memory plays little role for Creeley; it is the immediate present that counts.
12
Self-awareness is difficult to sustain: it is of the moment. Hence the choice
of the short—or serial—poem, for the mood cannot sustain itself. Again, the
poem’s aesthetic is by no means that of “No ideas but in things” (Williams);
indeed, things don’t much interest Creeley except as the occasion to brood
on a particular mental condition or emotion. No red wheelbarrows here and
further, despite its title, no rainwater either and certainly no chickens. No
sharp, imagistic phrases as in Roethke, no nouns charged with rich symbolic
reference as in Eliot, no proper names as in Pound and Olson, no occult
references as in Duncan. But no ordinary language as in Frank O’Hara
either. On the contrary, Creeley’s vocabulary includes precisely those
words and locutions others would avoid as “unpoetic”: in this case, “insisted
upon,” “something,” “getting out,” “tiredness” “wet.”
These words—and this is Creeley’s signature—are used with a
Flaubertian intensity that evidently escaped readers like Tillinghast and
Williamson. The “hardness” of rain is desirable because the poet is trying to
have a hardon. “Something not so insistent” is longed for as a form of
“persistence” that might be more appropriate. “Decent” goes with “wet” in
what is a near rhyme; “uneasiness” might give way to “happiness.” The
imperatives of stanza 5 counter the stagnation of passive and intransitive
constructions that have preceded it. The rain, for that matter, is never seen,
only heard; its “sound” must be countered by the sound of the poet’s own
voice, “Love, if you love me….”
A maker of words, then—of le mot juste—and also of the syntax that
relates the words in question. The poet as grammarian: a poet whose
inverted sentences, peculiar word order, and odd use of “literary”
constructions, even in his critical prose and in his many interviews, is
notable. I have always been struck by the idiosyncratic inflections that
characterize what purports to be “ordinary” prose. Here are some examples,
culled at random from interviews and essays between 1964 and 1998:
13
I think this is very much the way Americans are given to speak—not in some
dismay that they haven’t another way to speak, but, rather, that they feel that
they, perhaps more than any other group of people upon the earth at this
moment, have had both to imagine and thereby to make that reality which they
are then given to live in.4
I’ve always been embarrassed for a so-called larger view. I’ve been given to
write about that which has the most intimate presence for me. . . . And I am
given as a man to work with what is most intimate to me.5
I had headed west, for the first time, thinking to be rid of all the “easternisms” of
my New England upbringing and habit.6
There in Florida I thought a lot about the social facts of age, seeing us milling
confusedly in supermarkets, else risking life and limb trying to negotiate parking
lots in our oversized cars.7
Reading these comments, one can hear Creeley speaking (and, thanks to
Penn Sound, we can literally do this), not because his phrasing is
characteristic of what is called “speech rhythm”—the natural words in the
natural order—but because such expressions as “I am given to,” “I’ve been
embarrassed for,” “seeing us milling confusedly,” “else risking life and limb”
as well as the repeated use, in his critical prose and interviews, of the
adjectives “lovely” “beautiful,” “intimate,” and the parenthetical adverbs --
“unhappily,” “sweetly,” “forgetfully”--create an equivocal aura that is
uniquely Creeleyan. “There are lovely moments in the world” begins
Creeley’s 1974 essay “Last Night: Random Thoughts on San Francisco,” and
the same essay recalls that “The city was humanly so beautiful” (Real Poem
86). Most poets of Creeley’s generation would regard such value judgments
as too soft, too feminine, too gentle—aren’t these the adjectives a Girly Man
would use? Interestingly, Creeley’s female contemporaries—say, Adrienne
Rich—weren’t given to using the adjectives in question either.
“Lovely,” “sadly,” “confusedly,” “else risking life and limb”: it is the
14
decorum and politesse of these old-fashioned locutions that makes the
horror and emptiness of everyday life as depicted in Creeley’s poems so
chilling. In the 1998 collection Life & Death, there is a poem called “Edges,”
in which the poet recalls “want[ing] something”:
Beyond the easy, commodious adjustment
to determining thought, the loss of reasons
to ever do otherwise than comply—
tedious, destructive ineriors of mind
As whatever came to be seen,
representative, inexorably chosen,
then left as some judgment.8
Here it is the quasi-Victorian inflection of formal and abstract
diction—“commodious,” “otherwise than comply,” “inexorably”—that makes
the poet’s fear of old age and death, the “flotsam [another archaicizing
word] of recollection” so painful.
“As whatever came in to be seen”: Creeley’s genius is to take that
“whatever” –note that it is no image, no thing, no allusion, no citationall
reference—and to relate it to all the other words in a given poem, according
to the norms of what Aristotle called to prepon, fitness or
proportionality—the necessary relatedness of item to item and each to the
whole . Whether the words in question do or do not relate in the world
outside the poem is irrelevant; they relate within it. In “The Rain,” for
example, the second syllable of “decent” matches, not only the final syllable
of “persistent” and “insistent” but also the middle syllable of “intentional”
and with, a slight variant, the last syllable of “indifference.” Ent/ence: it is
the Latin suffix denoting actual existence, the state of being. The poem’s
repeated “insistence”/”persistence” defines the “I”, “myself” and “me” that
appear in the poem, first-person pronouns that fail to cohere into what
might be a stable identity. “Quiet,” furthermore, almost has the necessary
ent in it, and so does “wet.” But not quite, and therein, to use another
15
Creeley word, lies the problem. The poem gives us a personal world in
fragments or, more accurately, layers, and these layers remain separate.
The verbal and morphemic play in which a poem like “The Rain”
engages has a curious relationship to the poetry of the early sixties, when
Creeley came of age. On the one hand, as I noted above, it deviates
sharply from the Robert Lowell model. On the other, it is hardly a
minimalist “concrete poem,” even though Mary Ellen Solt, in her groundbreaking
survey, recruits Creeley for the Concrete camp, citing “Le Fou” as
an example of the poetic ideogram.9 But Creeley was no Concretist, as a
comparison to Augusto de Campos’s own rain poem, the 1959 “Pluvial”
makes clear. For de Campos, the typographic constellation—in this case the
morphing of the letters that compose pluvial into its cognate fluvial—has
eliminated all traces of the poet’s ego so as to make a linguistic-visual
construct [figure 2]. For Creeley, on the other hand, the lettristic
breakdown of a given word itself—in this case rain—is hardly enough to
satisfy the poet.
16
But Creeley’s own particular blend of linguistic density, elliptical
grammar, and semantic charge was to come into its own in the mid-eighties,
with the coming of a new generation of experimental poets. Creeley seems
to have known this:: in 1986, in a review for the San Francisco Chronicle of
Ron Silliman’s controversial anthology In the American Tree, Creeley
declared, “Whatever poetry may prove to be at last, the very word (from the
Greek poiein , "to make") determines a made thing, a construct, a literal
system of words.” “A great deal of the writing,” he adds, “has active rapport
with the resources that the system of language itself provides and plays
upon patterns of syntax and reference with remarkable effect.” Not
17
everyone, Creeley is quick to insist, will find such “structuralist” poetics
attractive: “We are, of course, far more likely to think of a poem as a
pleasing sentiment, a lyric impulse, an expression of feeling that can engage
the reader or listener in some intensive manner.” But, having paid “pleasing
sentiment” its due, Creeley concludes:
Certainly one will have favorites and I have a lot of them here, as it happens:
Robert Grenier and Charles Bernstein, and also Barrett Watten, David Bromige, Fanny
Howe, Susan Howe, Stephen Rodefer, Bernadette Mayer, Bob Perelman, and others.
Michael Palmer's "Echo" must be, surely, one of the great poems of the period, just as
Clark Coolidge's work is now a contemporary classic. . . . . The brilliance of the writers
collected here is not simply literary. Their response to the world, however demanding,
is intently communal. They are asking - often with great wit and heart - that we
recognize that language itself is real and we must learn to live in its complex places.10
I cite this review at some length because it shows Creeley’s clear-eyed
understanding that here was a new movement with such affinities to his own
poetry. Later, as that movement became more vocal and more doctrinaire,
Creeley took a more circumspect position toward it. He himself, after all,
belonged, or so the common wisdom would have it, to the school of Olson: it
was Olson who was his mentor and the New American Poetry, as defined by
Donald Allen in his watershed anthology, that was his poetic and spiritual
home.
The issue is complicated. Certainly, Creeley’s poetics is not quite that of
In the American Tree. What Bruce Andrews has called deprecatingly “the
arrow of reference” is still operative in Creeley’s lyric, his collocations of
words and morphemes are never as non-semantic or disjunctive as those of
later Language poets, his identity, however fractured, never less than
central to his what is a very “personal” poetry. The decorous, purposely Old
World phrasing--“I am given to,” “I am embarrassed for,” I am “thinking to
be rid of”— is surely closer to Robert Duncan than to Ron Silliman. And as
18
Theory, from Derrida and Deleuze to Adorno and Habermas came to
dominate the discourse of the various Language Poetry journals, Creeley
came to protest, less in print than in private conversation, that theory—dry,
intellectual, impersonal-- was the enemy of poetry, that he himself was just
a “simple” lyric poet who looked to experience and to tradition for
inspiration. Thus, in his last decade or so, he made sure he allied himself,
not just with experimental poets, but with the larger scene of postwar
American—and also British—poetry, endorsing a wide variety of younger
poets from Frank Bidart and Forrest Gander to Heather McHugh and Sharon
Olds, as if he wanted to warn his more immediate coterie not to box him into
a corner. John Ashbery, we might note, has followed a similar path vis-à-vis
the New York school.
Poets cannot, of course, be expected to see themselves as later
generations see them. It is too soon, in any case, to make authoritative
statements about Creeley’s influence today. Still, it may now be useful to
revise the earlier genealogy whereby we couple Creeley with Olson, Duncan,
and Levertov, with Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti, or with Zukofsky and
Reznikoff. Indeed, among the Objectivists, the one poet whose lyric very
much resembles Creeley’s is the one whom the label least fits—Lorine
Niedecker-- just as the “Black Mountain” heir whose aesthetic really is
Creeleyesque is that non-American, Tom Raworth. Both Niedecker and
Raworth may be characterized as mavericks. Both have strong group
affiliations but are loners, working in isolation. Both are obsessed, in their
condensed, “minimalist” lyric, with the grammaticity and paragrammaticity
of language, both are intensely “personal” and yet intensely oblique and
constrained love poets. To read Creeley against Niedecker and Raworth
suggests, in any case, that in making genealogies, it is high time to go
beyond nation and gender boundaries, high time to cast a wider net so as to
capture, in Creeley’s words, “whatever is.”


### From Odra, (Warsaw), nr. 10 (2008):
Interview with Grzergorz Jankowicz
Professor Marjorie Perloff: Internet Interview

Below Jankowicz is asking the Questions.  Marj (MP) is answering.

Questions:
1. In your book called The Poetics of Indeterminacy you have suggested that we can’t
really come to terms with the major poetic experiments occurring in the 20th century
without some understanding of what you call “the other tradition”. Could you explain this
general concept? How should we understand it? Is it historical, formal or geographical?
MP: First, please bear in mind that I wrote The Poetics of
Indeterminacy about thirty years ago! At the time, the New Criticism
still dominated, and John Ashbery was dismissed as much too
“difficult,” “incomprehensible,” purposely obscure. The “right” kind of
poetry (e.g. Robert Lowell) was representational and communicated
emotion in a comprehensible way, although poetry also had to have
some obliqueness, via metaphor and symbol. Lowell’s “For the Union
Dead” would be an example: the “giant finned cars” that “slide by on
grease” in the final stanza symbolize the replacement of natural,
organic animal life (fish) by the machines that have destroyed our
industrial world, and so on. In this context, I wanted to trace the
tradition that had produced an Ashbery or John Cage—I found that
there was an other tradition, in which language was at one more literal
and also more mysterious and that couldn’t be “translated” or
paraphrased. My poets were Rimbaud, Stein, Pound, Williams,
Beckett, leading up to David Antin, John Cage, and Ashbery. I
contrasted this “other” tradition to the T. S. Eliot “Symbolist” one. In
retrospect, of course this dichotomy is specious. Eliot, surely a major
influence on Ashbery, could just as well have been placed in the
opposite camp, and of course Mallarmé could have replaced Rimbaud.
I think what I really had in mind was less the poetry itself than the
way it was being read. Eliot’s New Critical heirs were read for their
“symbolic” meanings and you couldn’t do that with Ashbery. So from
that point of view, the distinction was, and I hope still is, useful.
2. You took the phrase from the title of a poem by John Ashbery (the poem was
published in 1977 in his book Houseboat Days). The phrase was actually introduced by
our poet in his long poem titled System written five years earlier. What is this curious
“other tradition” described by Ashbery?
MP. The “other tradition,” as the phrase is used in “The System,” is, I
think, part serious, part parodic. On the one hand, here and later in
Houseboat Days, Ashbery means that “you can’t say it that way any
more,” that in the later 20th century, there can be no way of
representing the “real” outside the poem in any sort of
representational way. But if you read The System, it’s also spoofing
art’s promises to be revelatory, to give us a special dispensation and
insight into the other.” The “other tradition” is thus itself ambiguous,
open, indeterminate—and that’s precisely Ashbery’s point, I think.
3. What fascinates me about The Other Tradition is that we can read it in two different
ways at the same time. On the one hand, it is a pure flow of language and images. But on
the other readers are able to adapt this dream plot to fit their own set of particulars. What
would you say for such a particular interpretation: the poem describes a poetry reading
organized in 1976 (it was written that year) and held in New York. The reading was to
commemorate the 10th anniversary of Frank O’Hara’s death. The other tradition is
actually O’Hara’s poetics. How far we can go with such reading?
MP. Well, I think that’s too literal a construction of the poem. What
makes it so delightful is that it relates to so many possible events:
college reunions? Political rallies? Poets’ Clubs? If you restrict the
meaning to the commemoration of O’Hara, why the “branches of
Norfolk Island pine” or, later on, “the idea of a forest”—O’Hara, after
all was wholly urban! So I will stick to my original reading; the poem
is at once literal—much particular detail—but also endlessly
suggestive. Then, too, if Ashbery had wanted to write an elegy for
Frank O’Hara, he would have. Why assume that the poem says X, but
means Y?
4. In the title of his lectures Ashbery used plural form: we have many different traditions.
What does this tiny but significant change mean?
MP. I actually think that the Charles Eliot Norton lectures use the
term in a very different sense. Here “other traditions” means quirky,
offbeat, not the usual mainstream, major poets. Ashbery, as he says,
wants to place himself with these OTHER poets rather than to claim
kinship with the usual suspects. It’s a kind of statement of
“difference,” oppositionality. But not quite the same thing as the
mysterious other tradition of The System or the poem by the title.
5. He chose six authors (five of them are English-writing individuals and one – Raymond
Roussel – is French). Ashbery says that his list contains only certifiably minor poets.
What is their current position in the history of English literature? And why they were
ignored by literary criticism?
MP. Well, I must say that from the vantage point of the critic—at
least this critic—the list is entirely eccentric. John Clare is a fine poet,
and Raymond Roussel very important to Ashbery, but the others are
eccentric choices. I personally can’t stand Laura Riding’s poetry—and
even Ashbery admits she has written some awful poems—and I can’t
see the fuss over David Schubert or John Wheelwright. Beddoes has
an historical interest; Death’s Jest Book is a fascinating quirky work.
But I think Ashbery chose these poets precisely in order to be
somewhat perverse. As he says, he felt he had nothing that new to
say about the Big Names—Stevens, Auden, Stein, or the Romantics,
but on these lesser poets, he could be quite original.
The poets in question are largely “ignored by literary criticism”
because they are, on the whole, minor poets. Among such minor
poets, Clare and Roussel stand out as poets that have a large following
of devotees. Riding has gotten her share of criticism because she is a
woman poet and has an interesting place in literary history. But the
rest are just not that admired.
6. I read Ashbery’s project as highly anti-critical (he does like to repeat Nijinsky’s maxim
that “criticism is death”). Are his essays of any interest for critics? I mean not for those
who deal with Ashbery’s poetry and want to learn something from his view upon others,
but those who work with poetry in general and are looking for a new perspective?
MP. I agree with you. Ashbery’s essays are fascinating as perhaps
prose poems in their own right; they teach us many things about
Ashbery’s perspective. But for poetry criticism in general, I find them
a little bit irrelevant. But this is true of Ashbery’s writings on painters
too. He seems to prefer, say, Fairfield Porter to Mark Rothko or
Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns. That doesn’t mean we should feel
that way. It is Ashbery’s poetic license to respond as he does. His
readings are interesting in taking nothing on faith, in drawing their
own conclusions.
7. Why do you think experimental poetry is less accepted by literary institutions,
establishment, and regular readers than other literary forms and conventions? One can
observe (always and everywhere – from Poland to the US) a specific resistance to
progressive poetics that subvert our lingual and literary experience. And why does– as
some critics try to convince us – this neglected poetry deserve readers’ attention?
MP. You answer your own question in your first sentence when you
mention both experimental poetry and institutions. The institution
(university, publishing house, newspaper) is by definition conservative
and the attack must always be launched from outside it. It’s so much
easier reading little lyric love poems or seeing conventional “problem”
plays in three acts than it is to do something new. But there are
always pockets of resistance. And indeed Ashbery, after all, has
himself become something of an institution. He is praised by all the
various camps of critics in the U.S. and abroad. In fact, one could
argue that he has been too unquestioningly accepted and it’s not quite
clear why some of the conservative critics like him.
8. Literary institutions have created another way of rejecting hermetic poetry. Instead of
neglecting it they normalize its subversiveness. In your essay Normalizing John Ashbery
you present how that academic critics, who dismissed Ashbery’s poems as so much
obscurantist doubletalk, have accepted its formal variety. Is there any chance for Ashes to
remain the invisible avant-gardist?
MP. Yes, this follows from the previous question. Those critics who
“normalize” Ashbery—and I think Helen Vendler is one—choose certain
coherent moments and relate Ashbery, say, to Keats. But the fact is,
as common sense tells us, that he is not like Keats. What I find
difficult and interesting is that many Ashbery passages sound, say, like
Charles Bernstein poems and yet the same people who love Ashbery
don’t usually like Bernstein. Why? Is it a preconceived reaction? One
answer, perhaps, is that despite all his strangeness, Ashbery does still
“express” selfhood—in ways different from the Language poets. But of
course the Ashbery of The Tennis Court Oath or Girls on the Run or
even A Wave is different—still the “invisible avant-gardist” as you put
it. And that’s the Ashbery younger avant-gardists often prefer.
9. In his 1968 lecture called The Invisible Avant-Garde Ashbery writes that there may be
a fine distinction to be made between “the” tradition (high modernism) and “a” (or
“other”) tradition, but the point is that there is no longer any doubt in anyone’s mind that
vanguard and experimental writing have their own strong institution that makes them
visible. Today all traditions and institutions seem to be in ruins. Do you think that it is
still possible to think about literature through the perspective of “a” or “the” tradition(s)?
MP. I actually don’t think all traditions are in ruins but that critical
discourse is very weak these days and doesn’t grapple with the
problems. Poetry reviewers especially deal with the present, failing to
see how that present relates to, say, the 60s and 70s. I notice that
the forgotten poets today are not the Modernists but the mid-century
poets—in fact, Frank O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg, etc., not to mention such
once-important poets as W. S. Merwin, James Wright, Adrienne Rich,
who came of age in the late 50s-early 60s. The question for literary
critics and historians, then, is how the poetry of the early 21st century
relates to its past. Another good question: the relation of U.S. to
other poetries—a very neglected topic. For instance: why is Ashbery
so especially popular in Poland? That’s not a rhetorical question.
What is it about Polish art/culture that responds to Ashbery so fully?
Poland was one of the first countries to recognize the genius of Frank
O’Hara too. Why and how?
10. In your response to Harold Bloom’s refusal of cultural criticism, you wrote that
Bloom’s insistence on the Romantic paradigm as the paradigm had made him curiously
impervious to some of the most exciting poetry now being written. I ignore the whole
paradox inscribed in Bloom’s argument (he refuses cultural criticism and at the same time
he invests his energy in thematic reading) but I am interested in his aims. Don’t you think
that by refusing linguistic analysis and taking us back to thematic motifs outside the
materiality of the poetic language, Bloom focuses on those modes of criticism that
enables him to establish the power of a poem over reality and other texts? Shouldn’t we
all follow that path? In other words: shouldn’t we promote poetry and stress its power
instead of stressing the reader with linguistic analysis? Or maybe Bloom simply can’t see
any other way to “promote” his poetical object?
MP. I think what you mean here is that Bloom goes for the big
picture, “placing” Ashbery in the larger canon and that this may be
better than engaging in close “linguistic analysis.” I have actually
come to like Bloom’s criticism much better than I once did, because at
least he deals with the literary, whereas so much of our current
academic criticism is mostly a way of foregrounding minorities,
women, various ethnicities. At the same time, I think Bloom made
Ashbery something he wasn’t: the ultimate Last Romantic. But
Ashbery has great affinities with W. H. Auden and the Eliot that Bloom
dislikes! So the thematic readings are fine but, in this case, can be
limited. Still, it was Bloom who put Ashbery on the poetic map to
begin with and that was all to the good.
11. What are the new trends focused on poetry in America? What are the emerging traits
that define contemporary poetical and critical scene in the US?
MP. Well, much of the most interesting poetry being written today
uses appropriation/citation in ways that we find in Ashbery himself,
where every line sounds as if it were cited from somewhere! It is a
poetry that plays down “originality” in the sense of Wordsworth’s
“overflow of powerful feelings” in favor of framing, recasting the
always already seen/read (déjà dit) as something new. In this sense,
younger poets may be said to be in the Ashbery tradition. But the
other news today is less Ashberrian. Concrete poetry is once again
very important, looking ahead to the digital. Ditto sound poetry. And
rules—like the Oulipo constaints—are very important. I just directed a
little symposium on Conceptual Poetry and its Others at the University
of Arizona (see website under “Arizona Poetry Center”). The poets
included Caroline Bergvall, Charles Bernstein, Christian Bok, Craig
Dworkin, Peter Gizzi, Kenneth Goldsmith, Susan Howe, Tracie Morris,
and Cole Swensen. Of these, only Gizzi and Swensen are in any sense
Ashberrian, and Kenneth Goldsmith, the advocate of “Uncreative
Writing” and being “just a Word Processor,” mark a return to Futurism
and Dada rather than the Ashberrian mode. Tracie Morris is a
performance artist, interested in Hip Hop, among other things. Susan
Howe is more Poundian, creating elaborate half-lyric, half documentary
prose works.
It’s a complicated poetry scene but very lively. I recommend to
your readers Ubuweb (ubu.com) and Penn.Sound (where you can
hear Ashbery read). The internet is where, currently, poetry is! And
there are brilliant texts to be read, seen, and heard there!

Song
Is it dirty
does it look dirty
that’s what you think of in the city
does it just seem dirty
that’s what you think of in the city
you don’t refuse to breathe do you
someone comes along with a very bad character
he seems attractive. is he really. yes. very
he’s attractive as his character is bad. is it. yes
that’s what you think of in the city
run your finger along your no-moss mind
that’s not a thought that’s soot
and you take a lot of dirt off someone
is the character less bad. no. it improves constantly
you don’t refuse to breathe do you (158)
164
Fifty years have passed since Frank O’Hara wrote this seemingly casual and
droll little poem about sexual desire—fifty years in which O’Hara’s reputation has
continued to rise steadily. Who would have believed in 1959, or in 1966, the year of
O’Hara’s tragic death at the age of forty, or in 1974, when Donald Allen produced
the first Selected Poems, with Larry Rivers’ notorious nude portrait of Frank on the
dust jacket, that by 2009, O’Hara would have come to be regarded, not only in the
U.S. but around the world, as one of the great poets of our time? Robert Lowell,
who famously dismissed as mere fluff the lyric “Lana Turner has collapsed” (1962),
written, so O’Hara claimed, in the course of a Staten Island ferry ride that took him
and Lowell to a joint poetry reading, is no longer much favored by les jeunes, even as
so many other notable poets of mid-century, from W. S. Merwin to Adrienne Rich,
have found themselves inevitably eclipsed by a younger, cooler generation.
But O’Hara? Not only is he now widely taught here and abroad (the editor of
the Selected Poems is the British poet-critic Mark Ford, a professor at University College,
London); he has found an unexpected popular audience as well. On YouTube, at this
writing, you can find three short video performances of “Is it dirty,” made by Joseph
Fusco (fuscofilm 2006), each with a different reader (Fusco himself, Dylan Chalfy,
Janet Shaw), the first read to music by Brahms, the second Artie Shaw, the third
Eric Satie—all containing distinctive Manhattan imagery from Harlem fire escapes to
flashing neon signs. Each gives an intriguing window on the poem, placing before us
the signature style that makes O’Hara so unique and inimitable.
Is it dirty? The question is almost rhetorical for Manhattan dwellers, whose
habitat—street corners, dumpsters, construction sites, subway platforms, park benches,
back alleys—is dirty by definition. But that dirt is taken for granted: what really
interests the questioner is mental dirt: dirty jokes, films, novels, and pictures, “dirty”
as in mild expletives like “You dirty rat!” And why is the city especially conducive to
dirty thoughts? Well, presumably, those who breathe in the dirty air, think dirty too.
The logic here is of course specious, but in the context of “Song,” it makes perfect
sense. The poem, moreover, immediately sets itself apart from the urban nightmare
poems of its time: unlike Lowell’s nerve-wracking New York of “chewed-up streets”
or Ginsberg’s “supernatural darkness of cold-water flats,” O’Hara’s “city hung with
flashlights” (19) is the American counterpart of what James Joyce called “dear dirty
1 6 5
Dublin.”
The key to “Song” is what Aristotle called in his Rhetoric the pathetic
argument—the characterization of speakers by their modes of second-person
address. In O’Hara’s lyric, meditation or description generally gives way to overheard
conversation: the address to a “you,” whether overt or not, shifting in the course of
a given poem even as it everywhere controls the discourse. Is it dirty? does it look
dirty? does it just seem dirty? The insistent and intense questions may be posed to a
friend, a lover, or even to the poet himself; then, too, in the case of the refrain “that’s
what you think of in the city,” “you” may be equivalent to “one.” What the form of
direct address manages to do, in any case—and none of O’Hara’s countless imitators
has quite matched this strategy—is give the poem an astonishing immediacy: the
reader, confronted by the lines “is it dirty / does it look dirty,” is instantly drawn
into the conversation. For what is “it” anyway—the “it” that may just “seem dirty”
of line 4? And how does “it” morph so readily into the “attractive” he of “very bad
character” in the third tercet?
Ordinary and colloquial as the language in that tercet is, the staccato
conversational rhythm—“is he really. yes. very / he’s attractive as his character
is bad. is it. yes”—heightens the intimacy of the discourse. And also its mystery:
who’s speaking here? Do we read “is he really” as genuine question, confirmation,
or sardonic response to the previous assertion? It all depends on pitch, as the video
versions attest. Are there two people debating the issue or even three? Or is the poet
daydreaming in a taxi? The ambivalence of pronouns is reinforced by the surreal
slide from physical to mental in “run your finger along your no-moss mind,” with its
sexual (masturbatory?) connotations—connotations confirmed by the comic line that
follows: “that’s not a thought that’s soot.” You don’t refuse to breathe do you?
O’Hara called the aesthetic that governs this process “Personism.” The
widely known 1959 manifesto by that name is so playful, so filled with declarations like
“You just go on your nerve,” “I don’t have to make elaborately sounded structures,”
or “While I was writing [the poem] I was realizing that if I wanted to I could use
the telephone instead,” that readers often miss the import of a passage that come at
midpoint:
Abstraction in poetry . . . is intriguing. I think it appears mostly in the
166
minute particulars where decision is necessary. Abstraction . . .
involves personal removal by the poet. . . . [Personism] does not have
to do with personality or intimacy, far from it! But to give you a
vague idea, one of its minimal aspects is to address itself to one
person (other than the poet himself), thus evoking overtones of
love without destroying love's life-giving vulgarity, and sustaining
the poet’s feelings toward the poem while preventing love from
distracting him into feeling about the person. (248)
The demand is for personal address on the one hand, depersonalization of the addressee
on the other. The poet talks, even here in his manifesto, to a you, he familiarly confides
in you, he is sensitive to your responses. But the particulars of the addressee’s identity
remains opaque, even when “you” is “me” or “us.” Thus, despite the well-known
campy explanation that Personism “puts the poem squarely between the poet and
the person, Lucky Pierre style, and the poem is correspondingly gratified,” O’Hara
mythologizes his “characters” by regarding them less as individuals than as players in
particular language games.
Such distancing is enhanced by formal control. “Song” is built on a sequence
of repetition with variation (“Is it dirty / does it look dirty . . . does it just seem dirty”),
refrain (“that’s what you think of in the city”), and off-rhyme, with the first five lines
ending respectively on “dirty,” “dirty,” “city, “dirty,” “city.” Once the dirty city motif
is established, the poem introduces a new motif: “someone comes along . . . ,” followed
by the clipped dialogue of the next three stanzas with its “yes, no” banter and absence
of all punctuation except for periods. The poem’s musical development comes full
circle with the repetition, now in a different context, of “you don’t refuse to breathe
do you.”
Despite its seeming ease, then, O’Hara’s is not an easy poetry. In making his
new selection, Mark Ford plays down the more clotted, surrealist experiments of the
early fifties (e.g. the long “Second Avenue”) as well as most of the charming but slight
later poems that O’Hara never intended to publish (e.g., “The Sentimental Units” or
“Bathroom,” both from 1963). Rather, the volume’s focus is on the great odes, the
“I do this, I do that” “lunch poems,” and the short lyrics and songs in the vein of
“Is it dirty.” As such, this new Selected contains almost no wholly negligible poems,
1 6 7
although it does include the campy—and to my mind, slight—early verse play Try!
Try! Indeed, the O’Hara who produced such brilliant conversation poems, faltered
when he had to write actual dramatic dialogue. One problem, of course, was that,
given the conventions of the fifties, O’Hara had to code as heterosexual the gay love
affair between his three principals. More important, the necessity of simulating what
people might actually say in a given situation prevented the imaginative transformation
that lyric permits.
Take the following untitled poem, also of 1959, that centers on a telephone
call to Frank’s poet friend Kenneth Koch:
The fluorescent tubing burns like a bobby-soxer’s ankles
the white paint the green leaves in an old champagne bottle
and the formica shelves going up in the office
and the formica desk-tops over the white floor
what kind of an office is this anyway (164)
Again: present tense, medias res. The reference here is probably to Frank’s new office
at the Museum of Modern Art, but the detail is less realistic than cinematic: one
thinks of fifties films like James Dean’s Rebel without a Cause, with its bobby soxers and
burning lights. White formica shelves going up, white desktops coming down onto
white floors: the scene reflects the poet’s inner emptiness, what with nature reduced
to a few leaves stuck into an empty champagne bottle. But even this description is
quickly interrupted by the exasperated query: “what kind of an office is this anyway.”
Is the unpunctuated question addressed to the self ? Memory of someone else’s
disparaging remark? The improvisational note, in any case, paves the way for the
phone call that follows:
I am so nervous about my life the little of it I can get ahold of
so I call up Kenneth in Southampton and presto
he is leaning on the shelf in the kitchen three hours away
while Janice is drying her hair which has prevented her from hearing
my voice through the telephone company ear-blacker
why black a clean ear
Kenneth you are really the backbone of a tremendous poetry nervous
system
168
which keeps sending messages along the wireless luxuriance
of distraught experiences and hysterical desires to keep things humming
and have nothing go off the trackless tracks
Address here is complicated: the poet doesn’t so much address Kenneth as relay, in the
present tense, (to another friend?), how miserable he felt, how he called up Kenneth,
and why Janice (Kenneth’s wife) wasn’t the one to answer the phone. The poet as
protagonist may well feel out of control, but the poem itself is able to relate everything:
“nervous” in line 1 above points ahead to the “tremendous poetry nervous system”
of which Kenneth is said to be the backbone, the kitchen shelf Kenneth leans on
connects to the shelves in Frank’s office: indeed, there seems to be one continuous
shelf from Manhattan to Southampton “three hours away.” And the hair dryer Janice
is using has the shape and look of the “telephone company ear-blacker”: the aside
“why black a clean ear,” which literally refers to the phone, thus slyly includes Janice,
straight from the shower, as well.
In this context the address to Kenneth has the directness of actual speech,
but the fact is that Frank’s words, as recorded here, are by no means a simulation
of the actual phone conversation. On the phone, one speaks of specifics (“why
did Vincent get mad yesterday? Or “what shall I tell Joe when I get home?”). “The
wireless luxuriance / of distraught experiences and hysterical desires to keep things
humming,” on the other hand, is a retrospective and abstracted description of the
poet’s state of mind, again, perhaps, presented as if in witty summation to a third
party. We can see this doubling over process at work in the final section:
And once more you have balanced me precariously
on the wilderness wish
of wanting to be everything to everybody everywhere
as the vigor of Africa through the corridor
the sands of Sahara still tickle my jockey shorts
the air-conditioner grunts like that Eskimo dad
and the phone clicks as your glasses bump the receiver
to say we are in America and it is all right not to be elsewhere (164)
Note that the poem never supplies the words of comfort and reassurance Kenneth
might actually proffer. Rather, Frank’s narrative of Kenneth’s cheering up is after the
1 6 9
fact: the poet can look back on the “wilderness wish / of wanting to be everything to
everybody everywhere” with some equanimity. And just telling it again and again, to
one of his countless confidantes, Frank can break the dark mood. Africa and Alaska,
emblematic of those far reaches beyond the poet’s grasp, are no longer threatening:
indeed, he can joke about the “sands of Sahara still [tickling] my jockey shorts” or
the air-conditioner that “grunts like that Eskimo dad.” Only in the penultimate line
does the “your” once again relate directly to Kenneth as Frank recognizes the sound
of his friend’s glasses scraping the phone. That sound as the phone clicks off is the
reassurance he needs: “to say we are in America and it is alright not to be elsewhere.”
Which is a way of saying that Frank is not out of line, that, whatever is at issue, he’s
doing the right thing.
“Personism,” as exemplified here, is thus artfully constructed, inviting the
reader to share what seems so private and is yet a common process of working oneself
out of an anxiety state. We don’t know from the poem what’s wrong with Frank, why
his life is falling apart, whom he’s in love with or just what “distraught experiences and
hysterical desires” have been bothering him. We only know that friendship breaks the
spell—“once more you have balanced me precariously—and that, as “precariously”
tells us, it won’t last. In O’Hara’s poetic universe, nothing does last, as the poet knows
only too well. The cream in the instant coffee is always “slightly sour” (100), the ice
in the whiskey melting (159), the lunch hour nearly over. All the more reason to savor
every moment: “There’s nothing so spiritual about being happy but you can’t miss a
day of it, because it doesn’t last” (99). And soon we will read “how sad the lower East
side is on Sunday morning in May” (213).
The longing to stop time in its “trackless tracks” is forever met by its opposite:
the desire to “keep up” the surface with what the early abstract expressionist Hans
Hoffman called “push and pull.” In a poem surprisingly not included in Ford’s Selected,
“To Hell with It”: the poet declares:
(How I hate subject matter! Melancholy.
intruding on the vigorous heart.
the soul telling itself
you haven’t suffered enough ((Hyalomiel))
and all things that don’t change,
170
photographs,
monuments,
memories of Bunny and Gregory and me in costume
(Collected Poems, 275)
Hyalomiel is a French trade name of a vaginal gel: lubricant is what’s needed to
give life to those static items like photographs and monuments. And liquification is
equivalent to surprise in O’Hara’s work: opening lines, especially, must jump out at the
reader. “The only way to be quiet,” he declares in the short manifesto lyric “Poetry,”
“is to be quick, so I scare/ you clumsily, or surprise / you with a stab.” And so we
have openings like the following:
I think a lot about
the Peachums: (“The Three-Penny Opera,” 1950)
Why do you play such dreary music
on Saturday afternoon . . . (“Radio,” 1955)
I’m having a real day of it.
There was
something I had to do. But what? (“Anxiety,” 1957)
“I think a lot about the Peachums” is wonderfully absurd because no one familiar with
“The Three Penny Opera” (whether the Brecht-Weill play or, as here, the film) has ever
given a thought to the Peachums, those vicious parents of Polly who are the purest of
stereotypes, functioning in the play to satirize the financial ills of Weimar Germany,
while glancing back slyly at the not so different mores presented in John Gay’s Beggar’s
Opera, which is Brecht’s source. The opening declaration is thus comically absurd,
as is the admonishment to the radio box in O’Hara’s second example. And it is the
candor of “I’m having a real day of it” that immediately engages the reader, especially
with the follow-up, “There was / something I had to do. But what?”
The immediacy of such poems is palpable, the comic-anxious moods
heightened by O’Hara’s tensile line breaks: “I think a lot about / the Peachums”
or “There was / something” in “Anxiety.” What, on rereading, I find even more
remarkable in these poems is their contemporaneity; often, they sound as if they were
1 7 1
written yesterday. Common sense suggests that, when poems use the particulars
of slangy, everyday speech—and in O’Hara’s case, the New York gay argot of his
time—along with former brand names like Hyalomiel or the “Heaven on Earth
Bldg / near the Williamsburg Bridge,” they would date quickly. After all, our idiom
in 2008—seven years after 9/11 and half a century after O’Hara’s radio days, his
screening of “Three Penny Opera,” or his late-night suppers at the Sagamore Café—
has certainly changed. The Cold War discourse and cold-water flats of O’Hara’s pre-
Stonewall Manhattan have been replaced by a much more corporate and dispersed
metropolis, whose poetic activity has shifted from the Cedar Bar to the internet, from
the telephone (not yet a mobile in O’Hara’s days!) to email and the blogosphere.
The presentness of O’Hara’s poetry depends, I think, on its peculiar
absorption of the public into the private sphere. Unlike the Lowell of “For the
Union Dead” or “Inauguration Day, 1953,” O’Hara does not comment directly on
public events, nor does he express political convictions. Rather, he makes the reader
feel what it meant to live at a moment when the Berlin blockade or the Cuban Missile
Crisis or, first and last, the threat of nuclear war was always on the edge of one’s
consciousness. For the private citizen, the morning news was—and this remains
the case today—paradoxical: on the one hand, the newsflash becomes part of our
everyday life; on the other, we absorb the news passively, it being quite beyond our
power to actually affect it.
“Poem” (Khrushchev is coming on the right day!)” is a case in point. In
September 1959, Stalin’s successor Nikita Khruschhev was the first Soviet Premier
to visit the U.S. Between high-level talks, Eisenhower entertained Khrushchev at
Camp David, movie stars entertained him in Hollywood, and of course he saw the
sights in New York. For the thirteen days of his trip, Khrushchev was constantly
in the headlines, his unsmiling (though sometimes broadly grimacing) face staring
defensively at his audience. What, under these circumstances, can we make of that
absurd opening line? Why is it the “right day” for Khrushchev to come to New
York?
From Frank’s particular perspective, this bright September day is the “right”
one because he happens to be feeling especially buoyant. It’s a gorgeous sunny and
windy day in New York-- “the cool graced light/ is pushed off the enormous glass
172
piers by hard wind / and everything is tossing, hurrying on up”—and his love affair
with Vincent is evidently going well, as suggested by the droll double entendre of the
line “last night we went to a movie and came out.” Wind, as I noted before, is always
a sign of life, of vitality in O’Hara’s work; it energizes the poet and makes even the
morning cab drive to work a pleasure:
where does the evil of the year go
when September takes New York
and turns it into ozone stalagmites
deposits of light
But where does Khrushchev come in? On the morning cab ride, the Puerto Rican
driver complains that “this country has everything but politesse.” Inconsequentially,
that evening Frank remembers the comment as he and Vincent are dining after the
movie. “Blueberry blintzes”: whether these are on the dinner menu or only conjured
up vis-à-vis the Russian motif, the speaker notes that “Khrushchev was probably being
carped at / In Washington, no politesse.” The joke, of course, is that it is Khrushchev
himself who is probably doing the carping and that, in any case, nothing could be
more alien to this dour personality than politesse or charm. Nor is he likely to care
what sort of day it was in Manhattan. Indeed, the subliminal presence of the Soviet
premier does color the poet’s mood: recalling his reading, last night, of François
Villon, “his life, so dark,” the bright sunshine is perceived as “blinding” and the poet
notes that “my tie is blowing up the street / I wish it would blow off / though it is
cold and somewhat warms the neck.”
It is a momentary tremor. The exhilaration quickly returns, the expansive
mood large enough to incorporate the dour presence of the Russian Premier:
as the train bears Khrushchev on to Pennsylvania Station
and the light seems to be eternal
and joy seems to be inexorable
I am foolish enough always to find it in wind (176)
The Khrushchev train, bearing down on Penn Station, can’t spoil the poet’s mood.
All the same, O’Hara concludes on a tremulous note: the light only seems to be eternal,
the joy inexorable. And the wind, we know, bloweth where it listeth. The poem, in
any case, traces the emotional arc of this poet’s response to public events, subliminally
1 7 3
present as he makes his way through the city. It is the banality of the political that
makes it so insidious. And again the pathetic argument draws the reader into the
frame, for “Khrushchev is coming on the right day!” is a quip evidently made to an
accompanying friend, and the whole “I do this, I do that” process seems to be relayed
to various intimates, with the poet wryly performing himself in their presence.
The lesson—if there is anything as solemn as a lesson to be learned from
O’Hara’s lyric—is the old one that poetry must show rather than tell, that poetry is
always a mode of defamiliarization. At a time where the poetry journals are filled
with trivial love songs and self-righteous anti-war poems—poems that present their
speaker as knowing self, telling us others what the right stance is—O’Hara’s poetic
instinct for the unbearable lightness of being is especially remarkable:
it’s also pretty hard to remember life’s marvelous
but there it is guttering choking then soaring
in the mirrored room of this consciousness
it’s practically a blaze of pure sensibility
and however exaggerated at least something’s going on
and the quick oxygen in the air will not go neglected
will not sulk or fall into blackness and peat (“In Favor of One’s Time’)
Or, as O’Hara put it in a neighboring poem, “it is possible isn’t it.”
